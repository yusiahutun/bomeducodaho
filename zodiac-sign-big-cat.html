Cats have been one of the most popular pets since the beginning of time and we truly can’t get enough of them. The way they ricochet from cuddly and domesticated to primal and petulant in a nanosecond makes them mesmerizing to watch. And because we all have feral side to our personalities, it’s time to discuss <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the big cat that captures each zodiac sign</a>, especially when they’re at their most wild, untamed, and unbothered.</p><p>From feisty and adorable beasts to terrifying and gargantuan predators, wild cats resonate with us spiritually on so many levels. They represent everything it means to reign at the top and hang with the upper echelon, where no one can challenge your superiority. These <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>apex predators</a> are not only fierce carnivores that keep the food chain in check, but slick hunters that can pounce on their prey before anyone’s noticed. They not only have the sharpest nails and the strongest bites, but they even have fur coats that have inspired entire movements in fashion. And even though they can tear limb from limb without flinching, they remain a highly fertile genus that cares for their young and purrs when they’re feeling content. Admit it: you know you wish you could <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>befriend a lion</a>.</p><p>Because there exists a ferocious feline in each and every one of us, here’s the big cat that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>captures each zodiac sign</a> and their insatiable desire to roar:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Aries: You’re the Tiger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-86070465.jpg><p>Aries is the quintessential “tough guy” of the zodiac. Ruled by Mars—planet of drive and dominance—their powerful presence and flare for the unique makes the tiger their primal counterpart. After all, this is the largest of all wild feline predators (and the most intimidating). It’s no shocker that the tiger has attacked more humans than any other mammals in the animal kingdom and an Aries can relate to their ability to bite back when they’ve been disrespected (metaphorically, speaking). Aries is also the zodiac sign of identity and no tigers ever have the same set of stripes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Taurus: You’re the Caracal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-541045478.jpg><p>Taurus always has a flare for style and can accessorize even in the wild. These Venus-ruled beauties deserve nothing less than to be represented by the caracal, the dessert dwelling feline famous for the dark tufts at the end of their long, elven ears. But don’t be fooled by their adorable adornments, as these fierce, silent-stalking predators will hunt for and kill… pretty much anything. These well-dressed big cats are opportunistic predators, anything from birds rodents to hyraxes and even small-sized monkeys. Come on, what Taurus doesn’t love to indulge?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Gemini: You’re the Cheetah</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1464178992.jpg><p>If one stereotype about Gemini is true, it’s that they can go from zero to a hundred at a moment’s notice. These quick-witted air signs often think—and move—faster than what feels necessary, much like the cheetah (a.k.a. the world’s fastest land mammal). One moment, they’re here, and the next, a Gemini is taking the conversation to a pace that reaches up to 60 mph. They don’t always sound as smart as they want to either, much like the cheetah’s roar sounds more like a cute, screeching meow. Plus, cheetahs are neither solitary nor social, much like a Gemini who truly can’t decide whether they’re an introvert or an extrovert.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>Cancer: You're the Sand Cat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-471880821.jpg><p>Cancers often appear cuddly, sweet, and innocent on the outside, but on the inside, they’re terrifyingly fierce. The sand cat can relate, as they’re really just ferocious beasts trapped in a plush teddy bear’s body. Despite their huggable appearance, these wild kitties are basically the ultimate apex predator of the desert, preying on rabbits, lizards, birds, rodents, and venomous snakes. Even their hunting style resembles Cancer, as they silently burrow beneath the soil just before pouncing on their next meal. They escape from the heat of the desert by sleeping in these burrows, much like Cancers prefer the comfort of their very own shell.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Leo: You’re the Lion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1478313319.jpg><p>The Leo could be ruled by none other than the lion, as this symbolic connection is canon. Ruled by the sun, Leos radiate royalty, prestige, and prowess, which matches a lion that’s always holding its head up high. Even the high-volume mane that male lions are famous for are like crowns fit for natural-born kings. Because Leos have a flare for the dramatic and love being the center of attention, you will find that lion manes grow longer and more impressive as they age. These animals see a carefully teased pompadour as a sign of dominance and that’s the most Leo thing I’ve ever heard. At the end of the day, a Leo just wants to relax and spend time with their many admirers, just like a lion would rather lay out on a rock and hang out with its “pride”.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Virgo: You’re the Serval</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1463376353-1.jpg><p>The long, lean, and agile serval represents a Virgo’s quick wit and efficiency. After all, servals are famous for their powerful hind legs, which allow them to jump as far as 15 feet off the ground, which is almost as far as a Virgo is willing jump to conclusions. This mutable earth sign is also known for reigning supreme when it comes to picking up on subtle, minuscule details and process all sorts of information, much like the serval’s heightened hearing abilities allow them to locate their prey underground. And although their unique body structure sets them apart from all other big cats, it’s actually what makes them one of the most well-built and finely engineered hunters.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Libra: You’re the Ocelot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-617886480.jpg><p>Libra is often the most graceful and alluring presence in the room, as this flirtatious air sign is ruled by Venus. It’s undeniable that the ocelot is among the most beautiful of big cats. Their alluring eyes and stunningly unique patterns make them incredibly gorgeous. However, they’re also one of the most communicative of all wild feline species, as they not only have many different meow sounds to indicate a specific message, but the males utilize their growls to attract a mate. Libra is the most romantic and relationship-oriented zodiac sign, after all. They’re also known for being indecisive and ocelots are famously picky eaters.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Scorpio: You’re the Lynx</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1143140688.jpg><p>Scorpio is known for being a highly enigmatic and mysterious zodiac sign, often preferring to put this conversation in vanish mode and keep their cards close to the chest. Like Scorpio, the lynx is the most stealthy of all other big cats, as these nocturnal animals are famous for stalking and ambushing their prey behind the cloak of night. In astrology, Scorpio is also considered one of the most intuitive zodiac signs and not even the most well kept secrets evade them. The lynx is similarly known for having a legendary sense of sight. In fact, many ancient civilizations believed the spirit of the lynx could see what everyone else could not.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Sagittarius: You’re the Jaguar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-640977760.jpg><p>Sagittarius is the zodiac sign of abundance and extravagance, as the jaguar’s unique spotted coat makes them a rockstar through and through. Like Jupiter-ruled Sagittarius, the jaguar is also self-indulgent, as seen in how this feline will eat pretty much anything. In fact, their predatory strength depends on them having the added bulk needed to take down larger prey. Sagittarius is known for sharing all their opinions—even the most controversial ones—and their blunt nature can be quite the silencer. Like Sagittarius, the jaguar has a super impressive bite that can easily tear through crocodiles and hard-shelled turtles. And if you’ve ever seen a Sagittarius deliver a scathing comeback, you know that it’s just as deadly.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Capricorn: You’re the Snow Leopard</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-521437042.jpg><p>Capricorns are famous for their ability to endure hard times in a way that makes the rest of us look weak or lazy. Snow leopards are much the same, as this wild feline has a beautiful and unique coat that is keenly adapted to keep them insulted during extreme cold weather. Like the snow leopard, Capricorns strive for reaching great heights and are disciplined enough to reach the tallest mountains. This rare big cat species lives in altitudes of up to 18,000 feet and they’re known for their patient determination, as they’ll travel more than 25 miles in a day in order to find food. If anyone is going to achieve the impossible in order to provide, it’s Capricorn.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aquarius: You're the Panther</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1037054092.jpg><p>Aquarius is often the most independent and unique of all zodiac signs, as they pride themselves in their willingness to reject the status quo. The panther is the rarest of all big cat species, as their endangered status—coupled with their ability to blend right in with the dark—make them extremely difficult to find. Aquarius can relate to the joy of being “off the grid,” as a panther’s dark and mysterious coat means they can easily conceal themselves in a shadow. Just when you think you know an Aquarius, they surprise you with a new side to themselves. And although most panthers are black, they also come in an even more rare shade of pure white. Aquarius often takes being unique to an extreme.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Pisces: You’re the Cougar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1296784847.jpg><p>Pisces is a dreamy and nebulous zodiac sign, and people born under this adaptable water sign tend to shift depending on their surroundings. Much like Pisces can take on multiple forms, the cougar has more names than any other big cat species. You may know also them as the puma, mountain lion, or catamount, making them as difficult to pin down as the elusive Pisces. Although cougars will absolutely lunge for a surprise attack if they’re protecting their cubs, their shy nature means they generally avoid humans at all costs. Every Pisces has a fantasy about watching the world from a distance without being seen. However, they’re also incredibly gentle to their young, making them among the most nurturing of feline mothers. Sounds pretty Pisces.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6N6o7XGZpqarF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./darryl-strawberry-wife-irs-mets.html>&#171;&nbsp; Darryl Strawberry -- Ex-Wife Loses $800,000 Dogfight Over Darryl's Me</a>
