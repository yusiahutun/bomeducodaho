The first time I made it, in the somewhat unlikely setting of a south London shelter for those experiencing homelessness over Christmas, diners were rightly suspicious of <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">its singed (some might even say burnt) appearance</a>. We’d had a large donation of cream cheese nearing its use-by date, and the chef in charge had recently visited San Sebastián, which explains why he thought this was the obvious solution, because back in 2017 I’d never heard of such a thing.</p><figure id=dbe36a59-f7c6-4ab2-998d-1801c45df327 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Thomasina Miers’ recipe for a festive guajillo and pineapple adobo roast hamRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Now, however, this simple baked cheesecake,<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> created in 1990 by Santiago Rivera</a> of the Basque town’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">La Viña </a>restaurant, seems to be, if not everywhere, then ubiquitous enough for the Times to declare it the “pudding that broke the internet”, helped in part by the recipe in<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Nigella’s latest offering, Cook Eat Repeat</a>. Indeed, food writer Ed Smith confesses that he was uncertain about including a version of this “food media darling” in his latest <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">latest book Crave</a>, yet, as he reasons, even after it stops being “A Thing”, the Basque cheesecake will still be “deliciously satisfying in its cream-cheesy, bronze-top-yet-wibbling-middle way”. Plus,<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> as Ravneet Gill observes</a>, it’s “so low fuss, it’s unbelievable”. What’s not to love, especially if you’re still looking for a high-impact sweet centrepiece for the Christmas table?</p><h2 id=the-dairy>The dairy</h2><figure id=b8f98fe6-364d-48a1-8631-78ea27465d66 data-spacefinder-role=thumbnail data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-13rnsx0><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Tomos Parry’s Basque cheesecake at his restaurant Brat features cheese, cream and goat’s curd. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.</span></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Actually,<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> as Nicola Lamb notes</a> in her Kitchen Projects instalment on Basque cheesecake, this is a dessert in which the texture is as important as the flavour, which means that you can play around with the ingredients to suit your taste – or up to a point, anyway. The backbone is, of course, cream cheese; for all the snobbiness around it in certain quarters, Rivera himself sometimes uses Philadelphia,<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> according to Gabriella Ranelli</a>, who runs food tours that often take in La Viña, and, of course, it works just fine. The major Spanish brand, San Millan, contains slightly more salt than the Kraft version, which means if you use the latter, you might like to add a pinch to your recipe, but the fat content is very similar. (My own preference, Paysan Breton, which, unlike Philadelphia, doesn’t contain any stabiliser, is quite salty already, so it’s worth checking.)</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Rivera’s recipe, as translated by Daniela Galarza from a YouTube video and confirmed by Ranelli (who tells the journalist there’s no big secret – the chef gives out printed copies all the time) also uses double cream, as does<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> chef Adam Rawson</a>, who developed the recipe used at the Standard in London. Gill goes for double and soured cream in her new book Sugar I Love You, which Lamb says “adds essential tang”, while Lawson uses cream cheese and soured cream.<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Frank Camorra of Melbourne’s Movida</a>, meanwhile, puts cheese, cream, goat’s curd and yoghurt in his cheesecake and<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Tomos Parry, of Brat</a>, the east London restaurant that perhaps did more than any other to put this dessert on the map over here, uses cheese, cream and goat’s curd.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>While the yoghurt and curd give Camorra’s cake a lactic lightness, and those made with double cream and cheese alone are deliciously rich, the acidity of the soured cream lifts the whole dish for me. That said, I love the denseness of Rivera and Rawson’s versions, so I’m going to use creme fraiche in place of the soured and double cream.</p><h2 id=the-eggs>The eggs</h2><figure id=ccc3428a-0e65-4c39-b28d-5d83691594e9 data-spacefinder-role=thumbnail data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-13rnsx0><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Sunny Lee’s brulee-effect offering uses yolks as well as whole eggs.</span></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Some recipes, such as Parry’s and<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Sunny Lee’s for Serious Eats</a>, use yolks as well as whole eggs, which adds richness without the textural toughness or “eggy” flavour that comes from over-egging the pudding, but my testers and I don’t find this a problem. Egg whites are always a pain to use up, unless you’re a body builder or a meringue fanatic, so I’ve stuck with whole eggs in my version.</p><h2 id=the-sugar-and-flavourings>The sugar and flavourings</h2><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>You can include as much or as little sugar as you like; Camorra’s cake is almost savoury, with just 115g sugar to over 1kg of dairy, while<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Galarza’s </a>contains nearly four times as much. As with the salt, it all comes down to personal taste.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Lee adds vanilla extract, Parry orange zest, Camorra lemon zest and juice and a slug of brandy, and<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Smith a couple of tablespoons of honey</a>. Again, up to you; Rivera himself tells Galarza, “If you want salt, add salt; if you want vanilla, add vanilla …”, and I must say that the freshness of the citrus zests is particularly nice against the richness of the dairy. Then again, given the strong flavour of the caramelised top, any extra ingredients might well be gilding the lily.</p><h2 id=the-starch>The starch</h2><figure id=85e376b9-c589-43ee-874b-78d3b449cc15 data-spacefinder-role=thumbnail data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-13rnsx0><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Daniela Galarza’s version: ‘It’s all down to personal taste.’</span></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Strictly speaking, you don’t need to add any flour – Galarza’s recipe leaves it out, andDave Beran of now-shuttered Santa Monica restaurant Dialogue <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">explains to the Los Angeles Times</a> that he doesn’t use it, either, “because the centre never gets hot enough for the starch to cook through and it ends up grainy”. If you’re making the cake more than a few hours ahead of eating, however, it’s a wise insurance policy – as Lamb points out, “a Basque baked without flour is quite weepy the following day, and having some flour in the mix helps hold the liquid much better”.</p><h2 id=the-mixing>The mixing</h2><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Some recipes just call for you to mix everything together and bake. The problem with this approach is that, while you want to make sure the ingredients are well combined, introducing too much air into the batter will give the cheesecake a light, fluffy texture, as opposed to the rich silkiness we’re aiming for here. It’s better to combine them gradually, and at a low speed: some recipes even call for a food processor, as opposed to a mixer, because, according to Beran, the latter can “overmix, then break” the batter. Rawson’s recipe suggests keeping the mixer on a very low speed, and adding the ingredients very gradually, while Lamb goes so far as to whisk the flour into a small amount of the mixture before adding it to the rest, which seems a wise precaution against pockets of powder – slow and steady is the name of the game with this cake.</p><h2 id=the-cooking-temperature>The cooking temperature</h2><figure id=97fbbd28-c4c1-4077-b094-2b470364d265 data-spacefinder-role=thumbnail data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-13rnsx0><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Frank Camorra’s version is almost savoury, with a certain ‘lactic lightness’.</span></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>I have to be completely honest now: even when Basque cheesecake isn’t perfect, it’s still great. Every single recipe I tried for this column was utterly delicious, but the single thing that makes the biggest difference to the texture of the dish, whether you want it smooth and dense and firm, like Gill’s, or ever-so-slightly oozy, like Rawson’s (which, once cut, resembles a ripe camembert) is its time in the oven – and we’re going for Gill’s “high and fast”. For this reason, use a deep tin, and make sure the batter comes up to about 1cm below the top; if your tin is too wide and shallow, as I find when I have to substitute a cake tin for Parry’s 25cm cast-iron frying pan, you’ll lose the textural contrast between the two.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Lee chills the batter before baking, in an effort to achieve the perfect balance between the deeply browned top and creamy centre, but then bakes it for such a long time at a very high heat (25 minutes at 230C, followed by 20 at 260C, which is almost self-cleaning mode in my oven) that I have to whip it out 15 minutes ahead of time when the smell of burning sugar breaks my resolve. Fortunately, the inside is pretty perfect, but I’m not sure the chilling can be credited for this.</p><figure id=bd3587d1-7e4b-47b9-b64f-1e87782e16c4 data-spacefinder-role=thumbnail data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-13rnsx0><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Ravneet Gill’s smooth, dense and firm version is ‘so low fuss, it’s unbelievable’.</span></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Conversely, those that are baked at more moderate temperatures, such as Parry’s 180C fan (though at Brat they cook them in a wood oven), risk overcooking in the middle before the top browns – or overcooking for my tastes, anyway. If you like your cheesecake firm enough to slice, and only lightly browned on top, this may well be your ideal. For me, however, an oven hot enough to yield a deliciously bittersweet, almost burnt crust, and a wobbly, slightly molten middle is the way to go. If your oven isn’t hot enough, you can always do as Camorra recommends, and grill or blowtorch the top (though I’m not sold on Lee’s idea of adding sugar to create a brulee effect – at such a high heat, it turns unpalatably black).</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>If you don’t have an oven thermometer, now is a good time to invest in one. A probe thermometer is also useful, but not essential – as Beran observes, it’s preferable to err on the side of under- rather than overbaking here; a sloppy, creamy slice is much more pleasurable to eat than fluffy, overcooked curds. But, as I said, this is the cheesecake it’s impossible to mess up.</p><h2 id=to-serve>To serve</h2><figure id=abcf73d1-00c5-439a-bf5e-751185daa539 data-spacefinder-role=thumbnail data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-13rnsx0><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Felicity’s hybrid Basque cheesecake.</span></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Lawson serves hers with a liquorice sauce, in homage to Nieves Barragán Mohacho’s version, Rawson a quince jam, Parry roast fruit; Lamb, meanwhile, makes a chocolatey version, and<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> at least two Michelin-starred restaurants</a> flavour their Basque cheesecake with blue cheese.
