In Audrey, we meet a complicated, insecure and troubled woman who, ironically for someone so popular, struggled to find love.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Audrey had depth – she suffered a lot in her life, and she turned that into something beautiful,” says Coan. “To me, that’s a wonderful and comforting story, especially at the moment – to show that trauma does not define you. You can turn it into something powerful and beautiful; Audrey is proof. For me, she’s a prime example of a woman who has been reduced to a two-dimensional portrait. Audrey was smart - she spoke five different languages. Everyone knows her face, but no one knows who she is.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for A must-see Audrey Hepburn documentary is coming soon" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/8b21f2fa-5a66-438e-9553-31aa7db56b7b/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1603370425_75157.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, director Coan shares the biggest surprises she learnt about one of the greatest icons of the 21st century:</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She had abandonment issues and struggled to find love</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Audrey’s parents split up when she was six and her father left the family. His departure had a huge impact on her particularly in terms of relationships with men. Both her marriages were very difficult. Her first husband, Mel Ferrer, was a strong, controlling man who could be quite difficult. In some ways he was quite similar to her father in that he was a commanding figure. Her second marriage with Andrea Dotti was particularly hard. He cheated on her many times – as her granddaughter tells us in this film, he was pictured with hundreds of different women during their marriage. Her father leaving hugely affected her sense of self-worth – she said that it left her insecure for life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Towards the end of her life, she started to accept herself more, especially after she had children. That’s when she met Robert Wolder, who was loving and faithful to her. They were together for 13 years until she died, and, although they never married, Audrey definitely saw them as husband and wife."</p><img alt="audrey hepburn and mel ferrer" title="Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer" width=5062 height=3379 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-89726676-1605812684.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michael Ochs Archives</span><p>Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer in 1956</p><img alt="audrey hepburn andrea dotti" title="Audrey Hepburn Andrea Dotti" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/audrey-hepburn-wedding-1526731193.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Audrey Hepburn with Andrea Dotti after the wedding on 18 January 1969</p><img alt="mandatory credit photo by mediapunchshutterstock 9912637aaudrey hepburn robert woldersaudrey hepburn robert wolders 1979 01 jan 2005" title="Audrey Hepburn Robert Wolders 1979 - 01 Jan 2005" width=2577 height=3607 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/audrey-hepburn3-1605869156.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mediapunch/Shutterstock</span><p>Audrey and Robert Wolders in 2005</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Her slight frame was a result of childhood malnutrition</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Audrey spent World War II in the Netherlands under Nazi occupation, where food supplies ran out. This childhood malnutrition stunted her growth and changed her frame forever. It was ultimately the reason that she couldn’t pursue her dream of becoming a prima ballerina, which is what she wanted to do initially. She was so malnourished that she didn’t have the strength. It was important for me to tell audiences that Audrey was so skinny because she starved. If you look at pictures of her before the war, she looked totally different. Her body is not something you should aspire to have; she ended up that way because she didn’t have a choice – as a result of tragedy. As far as I understand, Audrey had a heathy relationship with food. She loved chocolate and spaghetti and, in later life, would have a whiskey before bed.”</p><img alt="headshot of belgian born actor audrey hepburn 1929 1993 as a teenager with her mother, dutch baroness ella van heemstra, 1946 photo by hulton archivegetty images" title="Audrey Hepburn With Mother" width=5082 height=3388 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/audrey-hepburn1-1605866734.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Audrey with her mother, Ella Van Heemstra, in 1946</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She hated the way she looked</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Audrey says in the film that she wishes she could change everything about herself. She wished she was blonde and that she had a fuller figure. She is seen as often the most beautiful woman that ever lived, so that she found it difficult to find self-love was a real surprise to me. She was also very insecure about her acting abilities – she didn’t think she was a good actress. She’d beg for re-shots. She’d get very nervous and smoked a lot.

I would imagine she’d share them with Givenchy. She was so active in her wardrobe choices. She wasn’t just dressed by Givenchy; she was his collaborator. It was two artists working together to create the most pioneering clothes of all time. She worked very closely with him in making the little black dress we see in Breakfast At Tiffany’s; she understood how the dress would be seen by the camera, what needed to be there and what didn’t.

The humanitarian work for UNICEF was very important to Audrey; she herself had been saved by UNICEF from famine after World War II – she really understood what it was like to be a malnourished child. She didn’t let any of her trauma destroy her, whether the war, her father leaving her or dealing with cheating husbands; she instead went out into the field in Somalia and gave back to people rather than letting it ruin her. She ignored her cancer symptoms because she wanted to go out fighting for those kids.”</p><img alt="british actress and humanitarian audrey hepburn 1929 1993 carrying an ethiopian girl on her back while on her first field mission for unicef in ethiopia, 16th 17th march 1988 photo by derek hudsongetty images" title="Hepburn In Ethiopia" width=5230 height=3487 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/audrey-hepburn3-1605867193.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Derek Hudson</span><p>Audrey in Ethiopia during a UNICEF charity trip in 1988</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She changed Hollywood ideals of beauty</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She changed the idea that you had to be busty and blonde to be beautiful; she proved that you could be skinny with dark eyes and still be gorgeous.

She was furious at children starving for no other reason than bad, corrupt governments. Because she grew up in the war, starved and nearly died as a child because of Hitler, dictators and bad ruling, to see the same thing happening again – for children to still be going hungry – made her furious.

All you’ve got to do is look at the picture of Audrey with Trump in 1992 and it says it all.
