estate in Colorado for a whopping $36,000 per night.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I could live a lot of places — I choose to live here. It’s the perfect earth pushed right up against the mountain shoved against the ocean — it’s just smashed right in here and it’s our little paradise. The town has never outgrown itself. There’s still a charm to Ventura. When you look at the hills, they’ve really held back development and I hope they continue to do that,' Costner told Visit Ventura in 2017.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the same interview, Costner spoke about wanting to build on the land.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Costner and Baumgartner first began dating in 1998, having met around 1996 while Costner was filming his movie Tin Cup. The Bodyguard star said that at the time he first met her, he wasn't ready to fall in love again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both are graduates of California State University - Fullerton. Baumgartner graduated with a degree in business.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They married in 2004 in Aspen, Colorado.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The reason for the long courtship was because Costner was not sure if wanted more kids. The uncertainty even led them to break up for a period prior to their engagement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Fear kept me from marrying Christine. [She] wanted a child, but I was afraid I couldn’t be an effective father.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I woke up and thought, ‘Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?' That’s all it took. Sometimes you learn the thing you’re most afraid of will save your life,' he told Closer Weekly in 2018.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Costner was 'completely blindsided' by Baumgartner's decision to call it quits, according to&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>TMZ</a>.</p><img id=i-36a79431cfd5e50 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/04/18/70554471-0-Pictured_Kevin_Costner_s_wife_Christine_Baumgartner_was_seen_wit-a-40_1683222004207.jpg height=1253 width=962 alt="Pictured:&nbsp; Christine Baumgartner was seen without her wedding ring on Wednesday following news she filed for divorce from the actor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Pictured:&nbsp; Christine Baumgartner was seen without her wedding ring on Wednesday following news she filed for divorce from the actor&nbsp;</p><img id=i-2610244e6d5713a4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/04/18/70554295-0-Seen_with_their_three_children_Cayden_15_Hayes_14_and_Grace_12_i-a-41_1683222017420.jpg height=939 width=962 alt="Seen with their three children -&nbsp;Cayden, 15, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 12 - in 2019" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Seen with their three children -&nbsp;Cayden, 15, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 12 - in 2019</p><h3>more videos</h3><a class=js-move-prev href=# id=ext-gen42><span></span></a><ul class=rotator-pages><li class=linkro-wocc><a href=# data-page=1><span class=usability>1</span></a></li><li class=linkro-wocc><a href=# data-page=2><span class=usability>2</span></a></li><li class=linkro-wocc><a href=# data-page=3><span class=usability>3</span></a></li></ul><a class=js-move-next href=# id=ext-gen412><span></span></a><ul class="xwv-rotator js-itemList linkro-wocc rotator-panels"><li><ul><li class=link-xwv-v data-videoid=1345170227902005011><a class=videoLink href=# data-videoid=1345170227902005011 data-source="Capital FM" data-videoplayer-open-opts=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/3151969/video-options.json data-videoplayer-open-playerid=v-1220379371894258297><span class=wocc>Watch video</span><p class=video-item-title>Theo James speaks on his naughty experience at Nottingham University</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/20/82751095-0-image-m-21_1711054085674.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li><li class=link-xwv-v data-videoid=3465339658240541250><a class=videoLink href=# data-videoid=3465339658240541250 data-source=Instagram data-videoplayer-open-opts=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/3152887/video-options.json data-videoplayer-open-playerid=v-1220379371894258297><span class=wocc>Watch video</span><p class=video-item-title>Britney Spears stuns as she soaks up the sun at the beach</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/22/22/82795965-0-image-m-17_1711146978022.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li><li class=link-xwv-v data-videoid=4299722638691514288><a class=videoLink href=# data-videoid=4299722638691514288 data-source="Good Morning America" data-videoplayer-open-opts=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/3152501/video-options.json data-videoplayer-open-playerid=v-1220379371894258297><span class=wocc>Watch video</span><p class=video-item-title>'Little House on the Prairie' cast reunite 50 years after show</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/22/13/82776361-0-image-m-1_1711115648220.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li><li class=link-xwv-v data-videoid=5677366986624155879><a class=videoLink href=# data-videoid=5677366986624155879 data-source=YouTube data-videoplayer-open-opts=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/3151993/video-options.json data-videoplayer-open-playerid=v-1220379371894258297><span class=wocc>Watch video</span><p class=video-item-title>Who said his name?!?!
