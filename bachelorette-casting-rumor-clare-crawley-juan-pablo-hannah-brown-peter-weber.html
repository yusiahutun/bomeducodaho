This is all but confirmed with the fact that the big reveal is happening (before) the "Women Tell All" special and before Peter's season finale.</p><p>It's as if producers know this season is not going to sit will with fans and they want to get people looking forward to the next season of "The Bachelorette" even before they start clawing their eyes out at the trainwreck that will be Peter's finale (we're speculating here, it may be just lovely ... we doubt it, but it's possible ... but probably not).</p><p>E! went on to speculate who they think might make good contenders for the next Bachelorette, and whether or not they knew something they hit upon the woman whose name is now being tossed around as the unconfirmed confirmed next face of the franchise, and it's a call back to Season 18.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6a6e8385-783e-5754-8293-f0d7656b2688 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8925cc3d-e258-5e4f-be48-0ea81a75f0b5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dd/5by4/2020/02/26/dd8f6c20ce4a580697d35d5d328f6195_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chris Harrison Admits Peter Weber's Relationship with Bachelor Producer is 'Intimate'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>That's right, if the rumors are true -- and <strong><a href=#>"Reality Steve,"</a></strong> who is almost always right, confirmed this on -- producers are reaching all the way back to Juan Pablo Galavis' season where they've reportedly snatched up his runner-up Clare Crawley as their next leading lady. What's remarkable and refreshing and potentially great about this is the fact that Clare is 38 years old, turning 39 during filming, which would make her the oldest Bachelorette to date.</p><p>One of the criticism lobbied at the "Bachelor" franchise, and reality television in general, is that casting had been getting younger and younger in the past decade or so to the point that two of Peter's finalists are 23 years old, "Big Brother" is criticized for casting pretty faces over personalities and "Survivor" is being lauded for its oldest cast ever with its all-winners season.</p><p>Maybe reality TV will start to catch up to the strides happening in movies where there's this slow realization that people over 30 can still be interesting and, in fact, may well be more interesting because they've lived some life, suffered some blows and just generally experienced more of what the world has to offer.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:484f58a8-2bd5-5367-beee-d32265132af2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8925cc3d-e258-5e4f-be48-0ea81a75f0b5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/5by4/2020/02/25/a71c2565d1be5e0199ac67e00e5b4443_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bachelor Recap: Madison Gives Peter Sex Ultimatum Before Fantasy Suites, Follows Up After</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>There's a lot to be said for youthful energy and good looks when casting a television show, but there's more to life than that and there's no denying the potential substance that a woman approaching her middle age can bring to a dating show. Dating in your 30s is nothing like dating in your 20s -- and we're only assuming and hoping her suitors are aged up on average to better suit her.</p><p>Clare hasn't been absent from Bachelor Nation these past four years, either. She continued her search for love on the first two seasons of "Bachelor in Paradise" and even appeared in the 2018 "Bachelor Winter Games" series. There, she got engaged to fellow contestant Benoit Beausejour-Savard, though the two ultimately severed their relationship.</p><p>In other words, she has loved and lost twice with this franchise and she's only been off the air for two years (that's three less than Arie Luyendeyk Jr., though he may not be the best comparison considering how well his run was received). But the biggest thing about it is that she would be a fresh start.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4bbcbccc-ade1-5a16-bfa5-e526ae8d294a data-container-ref=toofab:article:8925cc3d-e258-5e4f-be48-0ea81a75f0b5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/35/5by4/2020/02/28/35a05f3e78b356b8892e85766d1b48e4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teddi Mellencamp Shows Off Her 'Day 3 Postpartum Reality' After Giving Birth</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>When they pull the next "Bachelor" or "Bachelorette" from the previous season, it makes the whole run just feel like one continuing story. Sometimes that works, but other times it can falter hugely, as many would argue has been the case this season. Peter certainly appeared to still have feelings for Hannah when this journey began, and the same could be argued for Hannah when her season began.</p><p>Sometimes people need time to heal their broken hearts after getting dumped on national television, but the "Bachelor" machien doesn't always allow them that time. Clare has been off living her life for two years now, so she's probably in a clearer and healthier head space than Peter could have possibly began when he started his season.</p><p>We're just a day away from finding out what the future holds for "The Bachelorette," but we'd be hard pressed to find a more interesting and potentially mold-shattering choice than Clare, who was a fan-favorite during her season and who can bring a fresh perspective to the franchise.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
