The stage will feature the label's bands Finch, Home Grown, The Starting Line, Rx Bandits, The Movielife and Allister, along with surprise performances by other Drive-Thru bands (and Drive-Thru friends, Glassjaw, American Hi-Fi and Autopilot:Off ) in select markets.

It is going to be an amazing opportunity for all of our bands to play and hang out together and meet fans from all across the country."</p><p><b>Grateful Dead Reunion Show Hits Snag</b></p><p>MILWAUKEE (AP) — A county highway committee denied a permit to the promoters of a Grateful Dead reunion concert Tuesday, saying the area could not handle the enormous crowd expected.</p><p>The Walworth County Highway Committee voted 4-0 to turn down the request by Clear Channel Entertainment to stage "Terrapin Station — A Grateful Dead Family Reunion" Aug. 3-4 in East Troy.</p><p>"You can imagine the amount of humanity that's going to converge on little old East Troy in Walworth County," said committee chairman Odell R. Gigante. "We only have 80 some sheriff deputies. Short of bringing in the National Guard we just couldn't handle it."</p><p>The two-day concert would have been the first time Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir staged a concert together since the death of Jerry Garcia, the Dead's leader and founder. Garcia died in 1995 of a heart attack.</p><p>Michael Cotter, an attorney for Walworth County, said Clear Channel can appeal the decision. The county would set up another hearing, and Clear Channel could present more evidence on why it deserves the permit. The company also can sue the county for the permission.</p><p>A representative who answered the phone Tuesday at Clear Channel in Milwaukee said the company had no comment.</p><p>"The ball is sort of in their court for what route they choose to take," Cotter said. "I'm sure they are not going to go away quietly."</p><p>Dennis McNally, a publicist for Grateful Dead Productions, and Big Hassle Media, the festival's publicist, had no immediate comment.</p><p>Gigante said 200,000 were expected at event, but only 35,000 are allowed in the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, about 30 miles southwest of Milwaukee.</p><p>The festival took its name from a 1977 Grateful Dead album. The concerts were to feature performances by the four surviving members as a band and also with their separate projects.</p><p>During their 30-year history, the Grateful Dead attained a fan base so devoted it reached cultlike status. Some die-hard fans, nicknamed Deadheads, followed the band around the globe for the jam concerts that became the Dead's trademark.</p><p><b>J&R Music & Computer World To Present SummerFest In New York</b></p><p>J&R Music & Computer <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/jrlogomusic.gif align=left border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> World has had a free outdoor JazzFest for the past six years in City Hall Park in New York each August. Now it is inaugurating its first annual J&R SummerFest June 13-15 in City Hall Park featuring R&B and gospel music. J&R is presenting the series "to thank the city for all their support" since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and to encourage New Yorkers "to keep returning to downtown Manhattan." The store is a block East from the former World Trade Center.</p><p>The line up is Boyz II Men, Ruff Endz and Mike Phillips on June 13; Ashford & Simpson and Alyson Williams on June 14; and Regina Belle, Hezekiah Walker, Boys Choir of Harlem and Woody Rock on June 15.</p><p><b>Jewel's This Way Tour</b></p><p>Jewel <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/jeweltour.gif border=0 align=right style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> has announced the artist line-up for the premiere Soul City Cafe ArtBeat performances, which will be featured during a special opening segment at selected shows on her upcoming "This Way Tour" of North America. Jewel and her mother and manager, Lenedra Carroll, have created Soul City Cafe as a multi-faceted program designed to encourage and expose developing talent.</p><p>M2M, whom Jewel saw perform in New York City earlier this year, were personally invited by Jewel to be her opening act on the entire tour, as well as headlining Soul City Cafe ArtBeat. Soul City Cafe ArtBeat will begin approximately three hours before Jewel's performance at each of the eight selected venues. The shows will showcase musical acts and spoken word performers. At the end of July, all the artists will convene in Jewel's home base of San Diego for a Soul City Cafe ArtBeat festival, with details to be announced.</p><p>The artists featured at the eight special Soul City Cafe ArtBeat venues include Edify, Dustin Fox, Nafeesa Monroe, Off By One, Rebeka Reed, Scooter Scudieri, Shade, and Think Of England. Their work spans genres, from acoustic folk to pop to hard rock to slam poets.</p><p>"I listen to all different kinds of music, and I think my fans do as well," said Jewel. "My mother and I are committed to supporting new artists, and we feel it is equally important that we not limit ourselves to a certain style of music. When I first went out on the road as a girl alone with her guitar, I often found myself opening for a hard rock act. It was a terrific experience to play in all sorts of situations, and it also proved to me that audiences are really receptive to a wide spectrum of music."</p><p>In addition, two emerging videography talents – Johnny Derango and Roberto Alcantara – have been chosen to work with a seasoned videographer to shoot footage of the shows. They are both students at Columbia College in Chicago. Their efforts will provide content for the Internet so fans can follow the Soul City Cafe ArtBeat artists' performances and behind-the-scenes action throughout the tour.</p><p>This will be Jewel's first major cross-country tour since the summer of 1999 and will stop at major amphitheaters and arenas across the U.S. and Canada. Jewel's live band includes: Mark Oakley (guitar, background vocals), Stuart Mathis (guitar, background vocals), T-Bone Hannon (bass), Steve George (keyboards, background vocals, samples, loops), and Trey Gray (drums, percussion).</p><p>Jewel began her 2002 "This Way" world tour with a series of Asian dates in late March and early April. She recently returned from a concert swing across Europe, including two nights at London's prestigious Royal Albert Hall.</p><p><b>Judas Priest Summer 2002 Tour</b></p><p>Judas Priest <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/judasripper.jpg border=0 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> returns to North America in July for a club/theater summer tour, in<br>support of the July 23 release of their DVD home video, "Live in London," filmed<br>last December at a special concert at London's Brixton Academy.
