href=#>Dancer</a></h3><p>Kaylani Lei tried her hand at various jobs before becoming a <a href=#>professional</a> <a href=#>dancer</a>, even competing in gymkhana in Ireland before moving back to the&nbsp;<a href=#>USA</a>.</p><p>Before entering the adult film industry, Kaylani Lei trained as a <a href=#>dancer</a>, honing her skills in the US before heading off to Las Vegas.</p><p>On arriving in Nevada, and before changing her name from Ashley Spalding to her stage name, Lei auditioned at various clubs and hotels.</p><p>After approaching one of the most notorious strip clubs in Las Vegas, Lei strutted her stuff at the OG’s Gentlemen’s Club & Male Revue.</p><p>Named affectionately as, Olympic Garden, the club catered to both men and women with the ladies downstairs and the men upstairs.</p><p>While she earned tens of thousands of dollars per week, Lei was looking for more and set about exploring options in the adult film industry.</p><h3><a href=#>Professional</a> Adult <a href=#>Actress</a></h3><p>After a successful career as an exotic <a href=#>dancer</a>, Lei branched out from stripping in Las Vegas, deciding to try out as a porn <a href=#>actress</a>.</p><p>To help kickstart her adult film career, Kaylani moved to Los Angeles, the City of Angels, to be closer to the major porn studios.</p><p>With her exotic Chinese/Filipino look and a body toned by years of dancing, it wasn’t long before Lei was cast in her first film.</p><p>She signed a contract with the world-renowned pornographic production studio, Wicked Pictures, and got to work on her first film.</p><p>Following the path of adult actors before her, Lei joined stars like Katie Morgan, Bree Olson, and Madison Ivy in pursuit of a lucrative contract.</p><h3>Award Winning Performances</h3><p>It wasn’t long before she made an impact on the highly competitive industry, earning awards and nominations for her impressive performances.</p><p>In 2004, she was nominated for “Best New Starlet and Best <a href=#>Actress</a> – Video” for her role in the X-rated movie “Angel X.”</p><p>This was quickly followed by a nomination for “Best Girl/Girl Scene” with Asia Carrera, a

platform for experienced hosts to discuss various topics related to sex and pornography as well as current events and industry <a href=#>news</a>.</p><p>With Kaylani’s background in the porn industry as well as her time at strip clubs in Las Vegas, she was eminently qualified to host a show.</p><p>She fronted the “Me So Horny with Kaylani Lei” on KSEX, an online radio show that allowed her to address issues close to her heart.</p><p>Kaylkani joins radio hosts like John Laws and Tony Blackburn who made a name for themselves with their popular shows.</p><h3>Mainstream <a href=#>Actress</a></h3><p>With her success outside the <a href=#>adult industry</a>, Kaylani realized that she could expand her brand, developing a career in mainstream <a href=#>entertainment</a>.</p><p>Her first venture saw her feature on Playboy TV, a move that improved her chances of creating another avenue for her <a href=#>acting</a> talents.</p><p>She then appeared on the Howard Stern Show, a guest appearance that raised her profile and provided her with entrée into television.</p><p>Lei managed to secure a role in the Cinemax series, “The Erotic Traveler,” co-starring alongside Divini Rae, playing the part of a <a href=#>photographer</a>’s assistant.</p><p>She starred alongside Patrice Fisher in a television series telling the story of a
