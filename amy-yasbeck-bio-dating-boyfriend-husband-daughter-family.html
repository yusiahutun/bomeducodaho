favorite American sitcom, Wings.&nbsp;Born as Amy Marie Yasbeck, the talented actress made her professional acting debut in 1985 in an unsold CBS television pilot, Rockhopper.</p><p>After an impressive performance in Rockhopper, she was given a role in America’s most popular daytime soap opera TV series Days of Our Lives in 1987.&nbsp;Yasbeck’s acting genius was, to say the least, strongly and massively felt on several television shows, including Dallas, Spies, Werewolf, J.J. Starbuck, Magnum, China Beach, and Murphy Brown.</p><p>The ever-impressive actress also starred in the Disney TV movie Splash, in which she played the role of Madison the Mermaid.&nbsp;Most people know Yasbeck as a first-class actress who brings out the best in every character she performs on the set. But few know that she enjoys playing mermaid roles in movies.</p><p>The actress’s love for mermaids goes back to her childhood. That’s when she fell in love with mermaids after seeing a Disney movie with mermaids.&nbsp;When Yasbeck got a big role as a mermaid in the American TV movie “Splash, Too” in 1988, this was the fulfillment of a childhood dream.&nbsp;She also appeared in movies like “House II: The Second Story”, “Pretty Woman”, “Problem Child”, “Problem Child 2” and “The Mask”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Amy-Yasbeck.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Amy Yasbeck Bio.</strong></h2><p>Amy Yasbeck was born on September 12, 1962, in Blue Ash, Ohio, United States of America.&nbsp;Her mother, Dorothy Louise Mary, of Irish descent, was a housewife, while her father, John Anthony Yasbeck, of Lebanese descent, was a butcher and shopkeeper.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Billy Campbell Bio, Married, Wife, Dating, Gay, Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>As an American middle-class family, Yasbeck’s upbringing was not desirable for John and Dorothy because of the family’s moral values and norms.&nbsp;When it was time for schooling, John and his wife enrolled them at Summit Country Day School. Later she joined the Ursuline Academy.</p><p>In the course of time, a very tender Yasbeck tragically lost both her parents to the cold hands of death. One died of a heart attack, while the other died of emphysema – a progressive lung disease.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Amy Yasbeck Husband/Family/Daughter</strong></h2><p>After making a name for herself in Hollywood, Yasbeck is one of the most celebrated actresses in America.&nbsp;But the actress is very famous as the widow of actor John Ritter, a legendary country singer, and actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Amy-Yasbeck-and-Husband.jpg><p>The couple met while shooting the 1996 Dennis Dugan film “Problem Child”.&nbsp;Ritter and Yasbeck finally began a life together as man and wife on September 18, 1999, after a beautiful wedding at the Murphy Theater in Wilmington, Ohio.</p><p>It was not difficult for Amy Yasbeck to be John’s wife in real life, as she acted as his wife on screen.&nbsp;Their longstanding intimate and romantic affair produced a daughter named Stella Ritter, who was born in September 1998, one year before their marriage.</p><p>However, the tragedy occurred on September 11, 2003, at Yasbeck’s home, when the family celebrated Stella’s 5th birthday.&nbsp;On that day Ritter fell into a coma while rehearsing for a sitcom – 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter.</p><p>The Golden Globe winner was taken to hospital and thought he had suffered a heart attack. But unfortunately, Ritter died at 10:48 that same night at the age of 54.&nbsp;It was later determined that he died of an aortic dissection resulting from a previously undiagnosed congenital heart defect. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park.</p><p>Unimpressed by the confusing death of her husband, Yasbeck filed a wrongful death suit for $67 million against doctors, radiologists, and cardiologists who treated him at the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center.&nbsp;She claimed in her records that the medical staff misdiagnosed his condition, which in turn contributed to his death.</p><p>At the end of the lawsuit, Yasbeck reportedly received more than $14 million in settlements, although the jury concluded that the doctors who treated Ritter on the day of his death were not negligent.&nbsp;John Ritter had three children from his previous relationship named Jason, Carley, and Tyer.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bill Duke Bio, Family, Wife, Siblings, Brothers, Net Worth, Height</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Dating/Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>When Ritter died and Yasbeck took the doctors who treated him to court, she was assisted by a very brilliant lawyer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Amy-Yasbeck-Dating.jpg><p>In the course of time and events, Yasbeck and attorney Michael Plonsker became so close that he began to develop Yasbeck’s teenage daughter as a father figure.&nbsp;14 years after Ritter’s death it was confirmed that the two were in love and dating.</p><p>The report was also confirmed by an unidentified source near Yasbeck.&nbsp;“Amy and Michael were thrown together by the unbearable circumstances of their trial. She was still grieving for John and frequently burst into tears.”</p><p>“It was extremely hard for her and Michael gave Amy a shoulder to cry on. As time went by they became closer and eventually fell in love,” the source explained.</p><p>Yasbeck’s newly found ‘comforting shoulder’ – Plonsker – lives in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>A successful lawyer, Plonsker has helped the actress’s family secure their financial future.</p><p>In 2010 Plonsker was named one of the “Who’s Who in L.A. Law”, the Los Angeles Business Journal.&nbsp;He was also named “Entertainment Lawyer of the Year 2005” by the Century City Bar Association and is featured in The Best Lawyers in America in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Amy Yasbeck Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The actress Amy Yasbeck has been very successful in her career and this is only due to her hard work and commitment.&nbsp;She recently sold her Beverly Hills mansion, which she shared with Ritter, for $6.55 million.&nbsp;The current net worth of Amy Yasbeck is estimated at around $5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>The beautiful and attractive body of Yasback is complemented by a height of 5 feet 7 inches.&nbsp;She has red hair, blue eyes, white face color, and an impressive height of 34-25-35.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51krq7FjLKYrJqVmLhursioZJ2ZpJ67qHnBqLCfqpmau6V5x66qm5memXqlrdSgn62domKzornIpbBo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ian-ziering.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ian Ziering - Bio, Age, Nationality, Height, Married, Career, Facts</a>
