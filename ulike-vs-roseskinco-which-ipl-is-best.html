It’s small, light, and easy to hold because it’s slim. The bottom is flat, so you can put it on your bathroom counter. Moreover, the device’s color is in purple shade and a mixture of white.</p><p>When you see the RoseSkinCo Lumi IPL device, it’s mostly white and gold. It’s a big, roundish device that’s a bit bulky and heavy. This could make it hard to hold for a long time when you’re removing hair. Also, the Ulike packaging looks fancier than the RoseSkinCo device, which has plainer packaging.</p><ul><li><strong>Inside the Box</strong></li></ul><p>The Ulike Sapphire Air3 IPL kit has a nice package with everything you need for hair removal. It comes with the IPL device, a long cord with an adapter, a comfortable razor for removing hair, large protective goggles for your eyes, and a user manual.</p><p>On the other hand, the RoseSkinCo Lumi IPL kit comes in a simple box. It includes the Lumi hair removal device, an adapter, and a user manual. However, its cord is quite long, which can be a bit inconvenient.</p><p>Also, in the Ulike Sapphire Air3 kit, each accessory is neatly packed in separate small boxes, making it easy to keep things organized. This is different from the Lumi kit, where everything is in one box.</p><ul><li><strong>Feasibility</strong></li></ul><p>Both devices are like phones with long cords. To use them, just shave the area you want to treat, plug in the device, and start your painless hair removal. But one session for your whole body and how easy they are to hold are different.</p><p>As we mentioned before, Ulike is light and small, so it’s easy to hold while treating yourself. It also has a mode that glides on its own, so it only takes about 7 minutes for a full-body treatment.</p><p>On the other hand, RoseSkinCo Lumi IPL is a big device with a non-slip surface, which helps you hold it better. However, it’s heavy and not very easy to hold, so you might drop it. RoseSkinCo takes 30-60 minutes for a full-body session.</p><p>So, the Ulike Sapphire Air3 handset is easier to use and gives a better treatment experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Number of Flashes</strong></li></ul><p>The Ulike Sapphire Air+ White phone can last for over 50 years because it has endless flashes. The Lumi phone, on the other hand, can last about 40 years since it has 900,000 flashes. So, you can share the Ulike phone with your sister, but you might want to be more careful about lending the Lumi phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Overall Cost</strong></li></ul><p>The Sapphire Air3 IPL device, including everything that comes with it, costs $299. On the other hand, the Lumi IPL device with its charger costs $229. But you’ll need to purchase the additional accessories for the Lumi separately. Still, it’s less expensive compared to the Sapphire Air3.</p><ul><li><strong>Safety</strong></li></ul><p>The safety of an IPL device is decided by whether the FDA says it’s okay and if dermatologists recommend it. The Ulike Sapphire Air3 hair removal IPL device has both of these approvals. It was given the green light by the FDA and other international organizations. Plus, dermatologists have tested and approved it, so it’s safe.</p><p>The SkinRoseCo Lumi IPL device is also FDA-approved, but we couldn’t find any research or recommendations from dermatologists about this 3-year-old device. So, if you want to be sure about safety, Ulike is the better choice for your skin.</p><p>Ready to experience the best? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here</a> to make the smart choice and buy Ulike Air 3 today!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Part 3: Our Tested Result: Winner between Ulike Vs RoseSkinco IPL</h2><p>According to the information we have, the Ulike Sapphire Air3 IPL hair removal device stands as the winner.</p><ul><li>The Ulike Sapphire Air3 is light and simple to hold. It also has a mode that makes hair removal quicker, with some users finishing in just 7 minutes.</li><li>The Ulike Sapphire Air3 has an unlimited number of flashes, so it will last a long time without needing new parts.
