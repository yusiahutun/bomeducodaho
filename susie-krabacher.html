She was caught by her abusive husband as well.

This is the reason she wrote her memoir which was published back in 2007. The memoir was called ‘Angels of a Lower Flight’.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u41891e3b9ef22dff40ccc3070202cb49><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Dwayne Johnson Biography</span></a><h4>Other</h4><p>Today, Susie Scott continues to serve her positions as co-founder and CEO of her self-funded foundation called HaitiChildren.
