I was sitting there looking out at the wing, and the entire wing exploded in a fireball. I was the only one looking out at the moment this giant turbine exploded like a comet.</p><p>“It was crazy.</p><p>“They shut all the engines off for a couple of minutes, so you’re just sitting there gliding with absolutely no sound, and nobody in the plane was saying anything. It was a surreal experience. They started the engines back up, and we did an emergency landing at JFK.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-leonardo-dicaprio-s-other-near-death-experiences>Leonardo DiCaprio’s other near-death experiences</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio’s plane incident could be a one-off, but the actor has had more back luck on the ground, too. Or in the water.</p><p>Leo was almost mauled by a shark when he was diving in South Africa. He says the humungous jaws were snapping at the star as he thought quick on his feet to get through the situation.</p><p>The 48-year-old <a href=#>movie</a> star said: “A great white jumped into my cage when I was diving in South Africa. Half its body was in the cage, and it was snapping at me.</p><p>“I sort of fell down to the bottom [of the cage] and tried to lie flat.</p><p>“The great white took about five or six snaps an arm’s length away from my head. The guys there said that has never happened in the 30 years they’d been doing it. It flipped itself back out again. I have it on video. It’s insane.”</p><p>Then the third time we could have been mourning the star was when his skydiving trip went drastically wrong. Whenever you’re about to jump out of a plane, like Leonardo DiCaprio, you want your parachute to work correctly. And if that fails, you definitely want the second emergency one to as well. But that wasn’t the case for the Aviator star.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke of his third scary</a> experience: “The other one was the skydiving incident. It was a tandem dive. We pulled the first chute. That was knotted up. The gentleman I was with cut it free.</p><p>“We did another free fall for like another 5, 10 seconds. I didn’t even think about the extra chute, so I thought we were just plummeting to our death.</p><p>“He pulled the second, and that was knotted up too. He just kept shaking it and shaking it in midair, as all my friends were, you know, what felt like half a mile above me, and I’m plummeting toward earth.</p><p>“And he finally unravels it in midair.”</p><p>We’re glad it did, Leo. That was close.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2Z%2FcLjEqKWaqpSkeqW1wpqnq6GfqHqxuMCnnGadnpy2r7GMm6Oer12qvW64yKScZpldm7azscGao6VlkqrBbrrOm6adsV2orqqwjJqlsqyYnruoew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./new-hong-kong-golden-bulls-side-play-chinas-national-basketball-league-will-have-home-games-city.html>&#171;&nbsp;New Hong Kong Golden Bulls side to play in Chinas National Basketball League, will have home game</a>
