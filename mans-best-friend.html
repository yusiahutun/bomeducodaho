There is a reason why we feel so happy around dogs. It is because when we are around them the love hormone releases ie oxytocin. Additionally, studies have shown that having dogs in the house unexpectedly lengthens <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">life </a>expectancy. Dogs and people have a special bond since humans have tamed them to the point that they depend on them for existence. Curiously, though, humans depend on dogs just as much as they do on us. Dogs can also be trained as therapy providers. They seem to be really helpful for various prison programs that benefit the rehabilitation of inmates because when a person visits a therapy dog ​​they feel positive emotions like joy and happiness and these positive emotions helps to spread positivity within the person which may encourage the person to introspect and bring a positive change.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>The health benefits of living with a pet include: –</h6><ul><li>A Longer life span.</li><li>Lower risk of cardiovascular problems.</li><li>Spread positivity within us & around us.</li><li>Mood booster as they enlighten our well-being.</li><li>Reduce stress and frustration.</li><li>Reduce ill effects of living alone or loneliness.</li><li>Help to stay focused and happy.</li><li>Increase opportunities for socialization.</li><li>Partner in various activities like doing exercise, going for a walk and playing together.</li><li>Lower the chances of mental health illness.</li></ul><p>Even if dogs did not provide direct health benefits,&nbsp;the love and companionship they give to us is priceless&nbsp;.
