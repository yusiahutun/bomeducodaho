There are a lot of existing industries and domains where one can start a business or a start-up, as a business or a start-up does not mean it is supposed to bring new and innovative products and services into the market, it also means providing the existing products and services in a much more efficient, affordable and scalable way.

The main questions arise as to handling a Real-Estate office, the manpower, and other tedious tasks but what if there is a way where you can start a Real-Estate venture online without any hassle of physically opening one and other related issues.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>1st Class Real Estate</a> is one of the leading and the only virtual Real Estate franchises.

Let’s hear more about the only virtual Real Estate franchise, their offerings, and the CEO’s professional journey.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Please tell us about 1st Class Real Estate, the initial challenges, and the factors leading to the growth of the company:</h3><p>We are a Real Estate Franchise and the only <a href=#>Virtual Real Estate Franchise</a>. We started Franchising in April 2019 and as of April 2021, we have 50 offices opened. One of our mottos is Changing lives and selling a few homes along the way! We had such a new approach in the real estate franchise world and not a lot of people knew about us. Getting our message out there and making sure it was noticed and understood was one of the challenges.</p><p>A triggering point in the growth of the company was finding people that were just as motivated as me. I wanted to find people who were motivated in opening a franchise. In 2.3 Years we’ve opened 50 franchises. Our first franchise was opened in April 2019 and since then we have grown tremendously. I am excited to see the growth of 1st Class Franchising 10 years from now. God has blessed me with a clear vision and purpose and that has allowed for my continued success.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tell us about the offerings of the virtual Real Estate franchise, new additions, and how these services are at pace with the changing times:</h3><p>We offer a cap 100% model, and we’re the first-ever Virtual Real Estate Franchise. You do not need to have a staff or an office to start your real estate business. Like I said above we are the only virtual real estate franchise. If you want to open a franchise with us you do not need staff or office space. Everything can all be virtual. Our Resource Center, where our in-house staff works, helps generate leads, provides marketing material and provides our franchisees and agents with 1st Class swag.</p><p>A triggering point in the growth of the company was finding people that were just as motivated as me.</p>Rhyan Finch<p>We base our decision on needs and feedback we have received from other agents and franchisees. I love hearing the feedback and always think about what would I want.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tell us about your professional journey.</h3><p>I am the broker, owner, and founder of 1st Class Real Estate and 1st Class Franchising. In 2005, I became a licensed real estate agent with a nationally known franchise firm in Virginia Beach and quickly exploded as I gained 100+ listings on the market after finding his niche in short sales. I became certified in Distressed Properties, Short Sales, & Foreclosures. As a new agent, I had great success and earned the Re/Max International 100% Club in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>In 2008, I gave myself a promotion and started my Real Estate Team – The Rhyan Finch Real Estate Team. I began with 1 agent (myself) and quickly grew to 5 agents within just a few months. At the time, I recognized what was going on with the real estate market and when the bust came, I quickly became an expert on distressed properties. In five years, I had taken his newfound real estate career in a crashing market to the number one team in Hampton Roads after joining forces with my sister Rhendi.</p><p>In 2012, the team grew to sell over 900 homes and consequently was named the #7 Real Estate Team in the US by the Wall Street Journal and the #1 Platinum Mega Team in Hampton Roads by the Realtor Association. After this track record of success, I decided it was time for the team to branch out and founded 1st Class Real Estate, an independent real estate firm located in Virginia Beach, Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now in 2020, as CEO and Principal Broker, the company ranks in the top 4% of real estate companies in the Hampton Roads area, with over 700 agents, and 50+ locations nationwide. My knowledge, and desire to excel have proven a track record of success for exponential growth. I started this company with one goal in my heart – to change lives so here at 1st Class Real Estate, our mission is to “change lives and sell a few homes along the way”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tell us about the work culture at 1st Class Real Estate and your views on the competition in the market.</h3><p>I’m always asking myself what I would want. I think it’s good to not have too serious of a work environment. I am very transparent with everything that happens so that do not leave any unanswered questions for my staff.</p><p>We do not have the mindset telling us that it is “competition”. We believe all of it belongs to us and they are in our space. I would not call it a motivating factor but I would say that we know it is coming, which in return drives us to push harder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZH60wIyco5qro2K%2Fpq3LZpysrJGpsm6%2Bx7KYp2WWnruktA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./king-charles-prince-harry-princess-diana-tape.html>&#171;&nbsp;King Charles 'Disappointment' in Harry Revealed in Princess Diana Tape</a>
