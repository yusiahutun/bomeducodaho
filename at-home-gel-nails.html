Sure, it cost a little more per session, but the money and time you were saving made up for it. But what to do if you’re not a salon-goer and prefer to do your nails at home? You’re in luck because these days, the market is flooded with at-home gel nails options that allow you to get that salon-quality, longer-lasting manicure, from your kitchen table. With so many incredible polishes, systems, kits and even press-ons on the market today, you can rest easy knowing your at-home gel nails are going to look professional, creative and chic — for less.</p><p>In fact, we tapped three celebrity nail artists including , and for amazing tips and expert advice when it comes to at-home gel nails, especially for women over 50. Continue below to find out all about at-home gel nails, how much they cost, the benefits, our top shopping picks and so much more.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is a gel manicure?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/gel-mani.jpg><p>“Gels have been popular since the ’80s but it wasn’t until the late ’90s and early 2000s that they started to become more accessible in salons,” explains nail artist <a href=# rel=noopener>Sigourney Nuñez</a>. “By the 2010s, gel services became a nail menu staple.” By 2015, almost <a href=# rel=noopener>one in four women had had at least one gel manicure in a salon</a>.</p><p>Their popularity makes sense because the approach produces excellent results. During a gel manicure, the technician will apply two to three coats of a gel-based polish that’s a bit thicker than typical polish. After each coat, you’ll place your hands under a special UV/LED lamp for 30 to 60 seconds. The drying process is called “curing,” and the polish “dries once being exposed to the UV rays in a professional LED lamp,” explains <a href=# rel=noopener>Tamara Di Lullo</a> veteran nail artist and CND Education Ambassador. Basically, curing creates a protective barrier against chipping and stripping.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The benefits of getting gel nails</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/purp-mails.jpg><p>Unlike regular nail polishes, gel polishes are made from ingredients that adhere to the nail tightly and are strong enough to withstand daily wear without chipping. Long story short: gel manicures keep nails looking gorgeous much longer than a manicure that uses regular polish.&nbsp;Regular polish sometimes lasts for just a few days, whereas with gels, you can expect them to last for weeks. “[Gel nails] are longer-wearing than traditional nail polish manicures and protect your natural nails,” says celebrity nail artist <a href=# rel=noopener>Pattie Yankee</a> who’s worked with stars like Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Allison Williams to name a few. And adds celebrity luxury nail artist <a href=# rel=noopener>Jenny Hart</a>. “Gel manicures typically last somewhere between 3-4 weeks.” And if you’re going for a gel press-on at-home option, those can last anywhere from 1-2 weeks, depending on how active you are with your hands.</p><p>And whether you’re a nail-biter or always manage to chip your nails, a gel mani just might be your best bet. “Gel protects your nails against chipping and breakage along with keeping them stronger,” says Hart. Plus, Yankee tells us you can also expect your nails to look better. “They are chip-free and provide maximum shine and volume.” These can both be said for in-salon and at-home treatments, but the biggest difference (and benefit) between the two is that at-home gel nails don’t require you to leave your couch — sign us up!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much do gel nails cost in-salon vs at home?</h2><p>The cost of gel nails is tough to determine, as prices truly vary greatly. “In-salon gel manicures range roughly between $40-$150 or more,” shares <a href=# rel=noopener>Queenie Nguyen</a> who’s painted the nails of stars like Goldie Hawn and Jessica Alba. Depending on the salon you go to (and whether or not you get a design), it really can seem like it’s costing you an arm and a leg to get your nails looking nice and fresh. However, with at-home gel nails or even an at-home kit, you’re looking at a much more cost-effective and maintainable price. “After an initial investment in a DIY kit, doing your own nails at home can potentially help save hundreds of dollars, and spare you the headache of making appointments,” Hart says. And for press-ons, they’re even better in terms of price, with plenty of options in the $10-$20 range.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel=noopener>Gel Manicures: Nail Artists Weigh In On the #1 Approach To Long-Lasting Nail Beauty</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Upkeep of gel nails at the salon vs. home</h2><p>If you’re like us, driving to the salon every few weeks and sitting in the chair for over an hour doesn’t sound like much fun. Sure, it can be relaxing for some people, but we think most women over 50 are looking for an easier way to get the perfect manicure. “Salon gel manis require maintenance every 2-3 weeks for removal and to have a new set applied,” shares Yankee. “At home, you need to remove them, but it’s more economical and easier to fit into your at-home lifestyle.” Especially if you have errands to run, meetings to attend or things to do around the house. Hart tells us, “Salon upkeep is inconvenient — any chipping requires making an appointment and driving to the salon to get the nails repaired,” she says. “At-home repair is much more convenient and can be done whenever you have a spare minute.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best at-home sets, kits and polish</h2><p>Keep reading to see our favorite at-home gel nails to try for yourself!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Best at-home gel starter kit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Red-Carpet-Manicure-Ultimate-Gel-Polish-Pro-Starter-Kit.jpg><p><strong>Red Carpet Manicure Ultimate Gel Polish Pro Starter Kit</strong> (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Ulta, $99.99</a>)</p><p>Never have we ever seen a cuter gel kit than this!

I never thought my nails would look as good as they do considering I did them myself!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make this manicure last longer</h2><p>While traditional nail polish might seem less time-consuming, in the long run, you’ll likely end up spending more time on your nails, dealing with chipping, removal and re-painting every few days. With gel nails, however, there are many ways to make them last longer from home, and it all starts with prep. “Nail prep is key — before applying a gel manicure, make sure your nails are cleaned of oil and residue with 70% isopropyl alcohol and that your cuticles are pushed back and cleaned from the nail plate,” says Yankee. “Additionally, using cuticle oil as part of your daily routine and wearing gloves helps a lot.</p><p>In addition to proper nail prep, your daily activities play a large role in how long your at-home gel nails will last. Nguyen has some great tips to keep in mind: “Wear gloves when you do dishes or other cleaning chores around the house to avoid damaging the gel manicure with cleaning chemicals.” She also loves a good ‘ol hand or nail cream to keep them hydrated, suggesting PAUME’s All-in-One Cuticle & Nail Cream (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from PAUME, $20</a>).</p><p>The most important piece of advice all nail experts offer is to not pick your nails. We know that might be hard, especially when you’re coming up on the end of your few weeks, but trust us when we say that by following this simple rule, you can elongate your mani by days if not weeks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to remove gel nails at home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/soaking.jpg><p>Removing gel nails from home is actually pretty simple! All you need is acetone and a cotton swab. “Soaking your nails with acetone and gently rubbing the gel off with a cotton swab is the best way to prevent any damage and keep your nails healthy,” Hart tells us.</p><p>And if you’re wearing press-on gels, like the Dashing Diva’s Glaze Gel Strips above, take Yankee’s advice: “Dashing Diva’s Glaze Gel Strips do not require soak off — just a drop of their Magic Off Nail Remover (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Dashing Diva, $7</a>) or any type of oil such as olive oil, coconut oil or cuticle oil at the cuticle line,” she says. “Then, use a cuticle stick to remove the cured gel nail sticker. It takes less than 1 minute!”</p><p>After your removal process is done, Nguyen suggests going in with one final product, “Apply cuticle oil to rehydrate and condition the nail plate post-removal.”</p><p>Related: <a href=#>How to Take Off a Gel-Manicure at Home</a></p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
