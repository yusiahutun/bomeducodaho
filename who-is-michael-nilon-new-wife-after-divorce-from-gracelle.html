Unfortunately, the two could only last a decade before Michael allegedly decided to cheat on </span><i><span>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</span></i><span> star!</span></p><p><span>So, who is Michael currently married to? Learn what we know about his new wife and more as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Michael Nilon New Wife After Divorce From Garcelle?</b></h3><p><span>Michael Nilon didn’t seem like he remarried after his divorce from Garcelle Beauvais. So, the possibility of him having a new wife like likely zero. However, as the talent manager kept his socials (with less than 1K followers) private, it could be that he wanted to keep his new dating life under wraps.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Michael married Garcelle on May 12, 2001. Sadly, after 9 years of togetherness, the couple then filed for divorce in 2010 and got divorced the next year.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, Garcelle figured out that her then-husband was cheating on her after discovering a message from a mystery woman that read, “I love you.” Devastated, the star then took to her IG to write, “You see, I thought I had won the lotto in husbands. Caring? Check. Attentive? Check. Loyal? Well, un-check. It only took one text message to change my life. That’s when I discovered my loving husband had been unfaithful. His infidelities ended our marriage.”</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, Garcelle knew the wonders of therapy, time, and some books. And more importantly, she put her love for their children above everything else — which greatly helped her recover.&nbsp; “First, I had to mourn for the marriage I thought I had. I had to forgive him, but I also had to absolve myself for not seeing the warning signs; for choosing this man,” she added.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Michael, Garcelle was married to her first husband&nbsp; Daniel Saunders from 1991 to 2000.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Nilon Sons</b></h3><p><span>Michael Nilon has twin sons named Jax Joseph and Jaid Thomas Nilon. They stepped into this world on October 18, 2007, after Michael and Garcelle struggled with fertility issues for several years.</span></p><p><span>In case you didn’t know, Garcelle had done a fibroid operation and had infertility challenges. No wonder, during their 5-year fertility struggle, she had three miscarriages and a failed in-vitro fertilization treatment. It was only at their second in-vitro fertilization the two were blessed with twins.</span></p><p><span>Now, Michael’s sons are in high school, and one of them is already making a name for himself on campus. In an IG post, Garcelle shared a pic of Jaid with a crown on his head on the football field at his high school. It seems he was named one of the “kings” of the court.</span></p><p><span>However, Michael’s sons had a rough start to high school before the happy homecoming moment. During an early RHOBH season 12 ep, Erika Jayne cursed at&nbsp; Jax while at Gracelle’s 55th birthday party. For this, not only Erika received backlash for her behavior, but also Jax was also hit with horrific comments and DMs on his Instagram page.</span></p><p><span>After the remarks, Jax then posted “I’m a f***ing 14-year-old leave me alone please,” and set his IG to private.</span></p><p><span>Heartbroken, Garcelle also took to her Twitter to write, “I’m usually a very strong woman I’ve been raised to be strong my life has taught me to be strong but when it comes to my kids! It hurts it’s not OK. “I’ve been in tears all night”</span></p><p><span>Besides Jax and Jaid, Garcelle also has a son from her previous marriage named Oliver Saunders.</span></p><p><span>Oliver was born on 22 February 1991. Now, he’s a rapper and married to Samantha Saunders (also known as Sam).</span></p><h3><b>Is Michael Nilon On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>mcnilon</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>mikenilon</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Nilon Age</b></h3><p><span>Michael Nilon was 55 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He is a year younger than Garcelle.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Nilon Job</b></h3><p><span>Michael Nilon is a talent manager who started his career a few years after graduating from </span><i><span>Swarthmore College</span></i><span> in 1989.</span></p><p><span>To be precise, he started as a talent manager for </span><i><span>Creative Artists Agency</span></i><span> in 1993.
