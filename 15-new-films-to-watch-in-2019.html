From the inventive brain of the film-maker Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster; The Killing of a Sacred Deer) comes The Favourite, a wickedly bawdy comedy set in the court of Queen Anne – the capricious, sickly monarch played with relish by Olivia Colman (who will further her royal duties in season three of <a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a15048525/the-crown-season-3-everything-you-need-to-know/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Crown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Crown</a>).

The wavering allegiances of the film’s warring women are endlessly watchable and crackle with a histrionic energy. Shot with a fisheye lens that further warps this distorted world of duck racing and seductive playfighting, The Favourite is delightfully outlandish and uproariously funny (its acerbic humour is evident in its ricocheting wordplay and stiff dance sequence). The movie is gaining momentum as an Oscar contender, and leads the pack with the most nominations at the British Independent Film Awards. Colman – who shines as the insecure, easily wounded monarch – may even win the Academy Award. She did take home the best-actress prize at the Venice Film Festival, after all.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘The Favourite’ is released on 1 January 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">3</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mary Cybulski</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">20th Century Studios</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The former New York Times-bestselling biographer Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) is down on her luck and behind on her rent. Fired from her copywriting job for swearing at her manager (twice), Lee refuses to bow to authority. The writer’s unwillingness to ‘play the game’ with her publisher has damaged her reputation and dashed her chances of securing a book advance. In a moment of desperation, Lee realises she has a knack for imitating the epistolary style of other artists. Fooling independent booksellers into acquiring her forged letters proves to be lucrative. So lucrative, in fact, that she and her friend Jack (a magnetic Richard E Grant) soon appear on an FBI watch list... The sophomore film of Marielle Heller (<a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/staying-in/a19559587/10-must-see-coming-of-age-movies-of-the-21st-century/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Diary of a Teenage Girl" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Diary of a Teenage Girl</a>), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a charming, understated movie that peers into the inner lives of two recluses. (Plus it’s refreshing to see two gay characters at the centre of a movie where their sexual identity is not its primary focus.) McCarthy – beloved as a comedy actress – stands her own in this drama, demonstrating her range as the spiky, sharp-tongued Lee. Based on a true story, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a thoughtful meditation on loneliness, friendship and celebrity.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Can You Ever Forgive Me?’ is released in cinemas on 1 February 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">4</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ANDREW COOPER</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If his claims about retirement are to be believed, this will be Quentin Tarantino’s penultimate movie. The provocateur has united the Nineties heartthrobs Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a tale of a washed-up actor and his stuntman trying to transition from television to film in 1969 (an amusing notion nowadays when A-list talent is <a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/g15880597/carey-mulligan-meryl-streep-colin-farrell-hollywood-tv/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="flocking to the small screen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">flocking to the small screen</a>). <a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/margot-robbie/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Margot Robbie" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Margot Robbie</a> also stars as their next-door neighbour Sharon Tate, the woman who was brutally murdered by the Manson family cult. Other cast members include Al Pacino, Dakota Fanning and Lena Dunham. Despite remaining close-lipped on the film’s finer details, Tarantino has said that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood most closely aligns with Pulp Fiction, and the movie's cinematographer has promised that it is “very, very, very Quentin”. In that case, expect stylised violence, cinephilic references and unbridled profanity.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ will be released in cinemas on 26 July 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">5</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">If Beale Street Could Talk</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Entertainment One</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After (eventually) winning his Best Picture Oscar for Moonlight, Barry Jenkins is back. The director's third feature – an adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel – If Beale Street Could Talk is a gorgeous, swooning romance thrumming with rage against social injustice. When Fonny (Stephan James) is falsely imprisoned, his pregnant girlfriend Tish (KiKi Layne) toils to free him, tracking down his accuser with the help of her mother (a heartbreaking Regina King). The movie is achingly beautiful; each frame, washed with vibrant colours and lit by New York’s late-summer sun, is like an Edward Hopper painting. And yet, the frequent intercuts between these breathtaking visuals and archive footage of police brutality demonstrates the fragility of the young lovers’ happiness, the lurking possibility of chaos. Sumptuous and arresting, If Beale Street Could Talk is exquisite film-making of the highest order and, as far as this writer is concerned, the very best movie of the year.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘If Beale Street Could Talk’ is released on 8 February 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">6</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Girl</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Netflix</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">How do you overcome a disjunct between mind and body? This is the question posed by the Belgian film-maker Lukas Dhont in Girl, a quietly affecting French-language drama in which the transgender 15-year-old Lara (Victor Polster) chases her dream of becoming a professional ballerina as she awaits gender-confirmation surgery. Lara’s talent is undeniable, the camera whizzing around her graceful pirouettes shows as much, and yet external reactions to her transition frustrate her ambition. She is bombarded with microagressions – from her little brother deadnaming her to her teacher questioning her right to use the female changing-room (a sinister echo of Trump’s transgender-bathroom policy) – that erode her already unstable mental health.

Brie Larson is suiting up to play the titular heroine in the comic-book studio’s first female-fronted movie, which is helmed by the husband and wife team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.

What starts out as teenage experimentation gradually engulfs the lonely, Rimbaud-reading Nic (Timothée Chalamet), who becomes addicted to crystal meth. His despairing father David (Steve Carell) is at a loss as to what to do with him, alternately spending thousands of dollars on rehab and withdrawing financial support. Nic is trapped in a never-ending cycle of relapse and recovery, a track-marked, vomit-smeared existence that at times makes for difficult viewing. The It boy of the moment Timothée Chalamet delivers yet another outstanding performance in Beautiful Boy, carefully calibrating Nic’s violent mood swings to create a heartwrenching portrait of substance-induced anguish. The actor also transformed himself physically for the role, shedding 20 pounds from his already slender frame to emulate the real-life addict’s gaunt emaciation. Beautiful Boy scored Amazon Studios’ best-ever opening when it premiered Stateside in October, largely thanks to the “Chalamaniacs” turning up in droves to see him on the big screen.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Beautiful Boy’ is released in cinemas on 18 January 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">9</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Charlie's Angels</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mike Marsland</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 2019 remake of the 2002 reboot of the 1970s TV show (you still with me?), this latest Charlie’s Angels will be headed up by <a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/kristen-stewart/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kristen Stewart" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kristen Stewart</a> and the rising stars Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska.

Three years later, his dream is a reality.

Colette is a simple-pleasures country girl who discovers the lavishness of Parisian high society when she marries Willy (Dominic West), an oafish boor determined to enter the literary elite at any cost. Undeterred by his own lack of talent, he achieves success though his wife, locking her in rooms to write then appropriating her work. Don’t let the premise fool you, Colette is far from submissive. She is spirited, sarcastic and sexually explorative – a thoroughly modern heroine notwithstanding her corset. Knightley, who is best associated with period drama, stood up for the often-dismissed genre when on the festival circuit with the film. “There’s a negativity around them because predominantly they’re female,” she said. “The strongest characters I’ve found have been in period roles.”</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Colette’ is released in cinemas on 11 January 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">11</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">The Lion King</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jason LaVeris</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this era where brand power is eclipsing star power, Disney is reinventing its classics for a whole new generation. The behemoth’s latest remake is a live-action version of The Lion King. Donald Glover and Beyoncé will lend their voices to Simba and Nala, while Seth Rogen and Chiwetel Ejiofor breathe life into Pumbaa and Scar. The film was shot using virtual-reality headsets, allowing the actors to wander through the chalky tundra of East Africa without leaving the lot. The first-look images bear witness to stunning cinematography, including establishing shots of stampeding animals and wide angles on burnt-orange skies at sunset. Fans of the 1994 original can take comfort in the fact that the plot does not seem to stray too far from its roots; most importantly, the new film will begin with the rousing power ballad Circle of Life. The movie is still a musical – with Hans Zimmer returning to rework his Oscar-winning score – meaning we could get the Beyoncé/Childish Gambino duet we’ve always dreamed of.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘The Lion King’ is released in cinemas on 19 July 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">12</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Where'd You Go, Bernadette?</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mondadori Portfolio</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An adaptation of the 2012 novel, Where’d You Go, Bernadette? is a heart-pounding thriller in which the title character (<a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/cate-blanchett/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cate Blanchett" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cate Blanchett</a>) disappears before a family holiday and Bee (the newcomer Emma Nelson), embarks on a journey to track down her missing mother. The director Richard Linklater reportedly auditioned 500 girls before settling on Nelson. “I was most impressed with her composure, confidence and unflappability,” he told Deadline. “Even though this was her first movie role, she was unintimidated.” Linklater enjoys working with young actors and draws out naturalistic performances from them (consider the annual check-in with Ellar Coltrane for his magnum opus Boyhood). 2019 is shaping up to be a busy year for Blanchett; alongside her film commitments, she will also make her National Theatre debut with When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other in January.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Where’d You Go, Bernadette?’ will be released in spring 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">13</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Boy Erased</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Focus Features</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hot on the heels of this summer’s indie hit <a href=# rel=noreferrer data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a23023799/chloe-grace-moretz-proposes-a-solution-to-hollywoods-diversity-problem/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Miseducation of Cameron Post" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Miseducation of Cameron Post</a> comes another gay-conversion drama, this one featuring Manchester by the Sea’s Lucas Hedges as Jared, a homosexual teen sent away to a correctional facility by his family. Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman play Jared’s rigidly religious parents, ill-advisedly believing they are helping their son by trying to “straighten him out”. The movie gained traction at the fall festivals, particularly thanks to Hedges’ sensitive lead performance, which marked the young actor’s first starring role (he will return to our screens later in the year opposite Julia Roberts in Ben is Back). Since sexuality continues to be policed in the United States – a country where 700,000 of its citizens have undergone conversion therapy – Boy Erased is, sadly, of-the-moment.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Boy Erased’ is released in cinemas on 8 February 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">14</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Vice</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt Kennedy/Entertainment One</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another year, another incredible Christian Bale transformation. This time the Oscar winner piles on 40 pounds and fastens on prosthetics to faithfully depict George W Bush’s right-hand man: the former Vice-President Dick Cheney. Having educated us on the finer details of the 2007 financial crisis in The Big Short, the writer-director Adam McKay is tapping into today’s politically charged climate with this fast-paced biopic. Vice will take us back to the Bush administration and reveal some home truths about the indiscretions of its key figures. The film boasts a stellar cast that includes Sam Rockwell (as the President) and Steve Carell (in the role of his Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld). We're particularly eager to see what Amy Adams will bring to her part as Cheney’s wife Lynne. If The Big Short is anything to go by, Vice will be smart and slick, an expertly penned distillation of complex, big-picture issues.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Vice’ is released in cinemas on 25 January 2019.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjqBpbXBnbIB1fo5qbGamlax6p7XLpqpmrJ9ixKLAwqFkoqZdZ31yhY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./129197.html>&#171;&nbsp;CAA Nashvilles John Huie To Be Presented With The CMAs Touring Lifetime Achievement Award</a>
