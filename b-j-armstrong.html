Armstrong was born on September 9, 1967, in one of the largest and most populous cities of the United States, Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>He spent his childhood with his parents and siblings in Detroit. B.J. grew up in a well-to-do family.</p><p>Talking about his family member, his father, <strong>Benjamin Roy Armstrong Sr, </strong>is a professional basketball player.</p><p>From an early age, B.J. was introduced to basketball by his father. However, his father, Benjamin, never let him win, when playing basketball. Once he quoted</p><p>‘Nobody is ever going to give him anything, if he wants to win, he has to earn it.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EeB1McsUYAAt4S--300x242.jpg><p>The information regarding B.J.’s mother and siblings is still kept secret and is not mentioned anywhere.</p><p>Moving toward B.J.’s academic records, he joined Brother Rice High School&nbsp;in&nbsp;Bloomfield Township, Michigan.</p><p>After a successful high school degree, he graduated from Brother Rice High School in 1985. Then the basketball player attended the University of Iowa for higher study and graduated in 1989.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no information regarding B.J.’s childhood days. However, if found, the readers will be updated soon.</p><h2>B.J. Armstrong | Age, Height & Physical Appearance</h2><p>B.J. is 56 years old. According to the horoscope charts, he belongs to the Virgo sun sign. And from what we know, they are Loyal, analytical, kind, hardworking, practical, and have a deep sense of humanity.</p><p>Armstrong somewhat matches the character. Moreover, by his birth name, the basketball player is <strong>Benjamin Roy “B. J.” Armstrong Jr</strong>.</p><p>The basketball player is blessed when it comes to height. He stands tall, with an impressive height of 1.88 m.</p><p>In the same way, with a body weight of 175 lb, he engages in an intense workout routine to maintain his athletic frame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Young-Armstrong-Source-Famous-People-Today.jpg><p>But, again, this seems to be an average weight for a basketball player like him.</p><p>Armstrong has a stunning body appearance among other players his age, very strict with his physical fitness and diet.</p><p>However, his looks are incomplete without shiny black hair and black pairs of eyes.</p><p>Unfortunately, B.J.’s body measurements are still unknown to the public. Therefore, despite much research and study, we cannot find some information on young basketball players like shoe size, hobbies, and many more.</p><p>Not to mention, Armstrong belongs to the American nationality. However, the ethnicity and religion he follows are still unknown to the public.</p><h2>B.J. Armstrong | Professional Career</h2><h3>Early Career</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, B.J. started a career in basketball at an early age in his life. After joining Brother Rice High School, he set 17 records, averaging 27 points and 5 rebounds for a team, and finished a game with 20-4.</p><p>In 1984-1985, he was named All-State, All-City, and All-Conference teams in high school. Moreover, Armstrong captained the U.S. All-star team in Germany’s 1985 Albert Schweitzer Games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Untitled-design-71.jpg><p>After joining the University of Iowa, the young player practiced his shooting every day to 1,500 shots per day.</p><p>This practice paid off when B.J. and his University team reached Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA Basketball Tournament.</p><p>Armstrong finished his University career with an all-time assists record of 517, third all-time scorer, third in steals (178), and fourth in points (1705).</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>After a successful basketball career at the University of Iowa, B.J. got drafted by the Chicago Bulls as the 18th pick in the NBA draft in June 1989.</p><p>He played 81 games in the first year at Chicago Bulls with an average of 5.6 points a game.</p><p>With a free throw of 28, the young player set a record for the longest streak of consecutive free throws. Also, Armstrong helped win the NBA title after winning 61 games against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1991.</p><p>However, in 1994, he missed one of his games because the Los Angeles Lakers played<strong> Magic Jordan</strong> for the entire game. This became only the game that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Armstrong missed in his career.</a></strong></p><p></p><p>The young player improved his scoring skills in the following seasons but didn’t become the team’s starter.</p><p>Moreover, coach <strong>Phil Jackson </strong>advised B.J. to improve his three-point shooting.</p><p>After that, he improved his three-point shooting and won the NBA’s Three-Point Field Goal Percentage title with a 453 (63-for-139) average.</p><p>B.J once said:</p><p>“You always want to bring new things to your game; I remember Magic and Bird always talked about adding new twists. The three-point shot was mine.”</p><h4>After 1994</h4><p>In 1995, B.J. and the Bulls scored 47-35, leading the team to the second round.</p><p>After Chicago Bulls, he got chosen by Toronto Raptors for the 1995 NBA Expansion Draft.</p><p>But Armstrong refused this offer and was drafted to Golden State Warriors in exchange for <strong>Carlos Rogers</strong>. With this, the young basketball player played for the warriors from 1996-1997.</p><p>When the contract ended with the Warriors, B.J. signed with <span id=Charlotte_Hornets class=mw-headline>Charlotte Hornets for the 1997-98 season. He finished the 1997-98 season with 62 games.</span></p><p><span id=Charlotte_Hornets class=mw-headline>However, Benjamin Roy played 10 more games for the 1999 season with the Hornets. </span>For the 1998-99 season, Armstrong signed up with Orlando Magic.</p><p>Surprisingly, B.J. returned to the team where he started his professional career in basketball. Yes, you heard it right. The young player was signed by the Chicago bulls 1999–2000 season.</p><p>Sadly, we couldn’t see this talented player on the basketball court for longer. After the 1999-2000 season ended, Armstrong retired from basketball.</p><p>So, this became heartbreaking news to his fans worldwide.</p><h3>Post Retirement</h3><p>Armstrong continued his career even after retirement but not as a basketball player. The last team he played basketball with was Chicago Bulls.</p><p>So right after he retired from basketball, he served as a special assistant to the Vice president of the Chicago Bulls, <strong>Jerry Krause</strong>.</p><p>The former basketball player remained with Chicago for two more years as a scout member and left in 2005.</p><p>After that, B.J. joined ESPN’s&nbsp;NBA Fast Break series and worked as a basketball analyst.</p><p>In 2006, he affiliated with Wasserman Media Group, representing athletes and entertainers. B.J. is still affiliated with Wasserman Media Group and serves as EVP&nbsp;& Managing Executive.</p><h3>B.J.
