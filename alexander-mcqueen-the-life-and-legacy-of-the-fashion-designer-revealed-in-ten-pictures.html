He on occasion would wear frilly socks. And certainly at school I know that certain characters would be unpleasant to him, and they used to call him 'query McQueen', which he said really hurt him. He would express darker sides of himself through drawings, like something inside of him was trying to get out.”</p><p id=ePdpQephrr data-wc=52>Although Lee was initially encouraged to take up a mechanical trade, at the age of 16 he saw an advertisement for an apprenticeship at traditional Saville Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, and applied for the role. “Sitting in a small workshop, padding lapels...God it was so boring,” Lee says in archive footage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e5f178ead00-gettyimages-82798028.jpg><p id=ebNuQmjMpkG data-wc=87>The second image was revealed by Simon Ungless, a fellow student at Central Saint Martins, who Lee met on his first day at the design college. The photograph was taken in Milan in 1990, when he briefly worked for Italian fashion house Romeo Gigli. “It looks like they’re building the collection, designing," Ungless says. "His sketches were unlike anybody else’s work. He dipped a claw into ink and scratched it. Girls had no hair, beady little eyes, pointed noses, pointed ears. Completely different from anyone else’s work."</p><p id=eGA0CYEP3Vn data-wc=80>The same year Lee won a place at Central Saint Martins. “It was the place to go, but what I liked about it was the freedom of expression and being surrounded by like-minded people,” Lee says in an archive interview. “A single-breasted jacket is a single-breasted jacket, it doesn’t move on. A double-breasted, is a double breasted. A jacket’s a jacket. But I wanted to pull the lapels behind the back of the neck, up the arse and everywhere else.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="'High & Low - John Galliano' explores the fashion designer's journey from stardom to turmoil" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a4801cb0fb98-high-lowstill7.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="'High & Low - John Galliano' explores the fashion designer's journey from stardom to turmoil" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>'High & Low - John Galliano' explores the fashion designer's journey from stardom to turmoil</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Seán McGirr has been named as Sarah Burton's replacement at Alexander McQueen" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1f6513ee0856-gettyimages-163142001.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Seán McGirr has been named as Sarah Burton's replacement at Alexander McQueen" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Seán McGirr has been named as Sarah Burton's replacement at Alexander McQueen</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=enbnqoNJ14X data-wc=86>It was Lee’s graduate show, ‘Jack the Ripper Stalks his Victims’, that caught the eye of Fashion Editor Isabella Blow. "The pieces moved past me in a way I’d never seen. They were modern, they were classical. The colours were very extreme. There was a black coat and then he would line it with human hair. I just thought, ‘this is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen’,” says Isabella, who purchased the entire collection and would go on to mentor the designer throughout his career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67bad1b81931-gettyimages-3159709.jpg><p id=eqcuw2C_Wsd data-wc=60>The third image was taken by photographer Gary Wallis, who was called upon to make a film to promote Alexander McQueen at an event in New York. It was shot at Hilles House, Isabella’s sprawling Gloucestershire estate. She was wearing pieces from his collection and he his uniform at the time: baggy jeans, a lumberjack shirt and an army jacket.&nbsp;</p><p id=epUj1EWcHSb data-wc=41>“I don’t know whether he’s laughing at her or going to throttle her,” Wallis says, “It [their relationship] was a form of a love-affair. Not romantically, but she adored him - she adored his energy and obviously passionately adored his work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/316e9376895b-gettyimages-1355508286.jpg><p id=eVvNxlV-Goo data-wc=34>This was around the time Alexander McQueen was established, Isabella had encouraged him to drop the ‘Lee’ as she believed that Alexander sounded more British - and she saw him as Alexander the Great.&nbsp;</p><p id=ee52Wjcp3-j data-wc=50>Next up was ex-boyfriend Andrew Groves, showing a picture of the couple together with matching buzz cuts at a club in Soho, in 1994. “Whenever we went out we were in trouble in a good way. We didn’t have any money, but we had clippers, so we shaved our hair.”</p><p id=eFGG5LLmgzm data-wc=77>He recalls when the couple were living in what he described as "a squat", Lee peeled a shirt from a pile of clothes on the floor, and said, ‘I’ve got to go out, I’ll be back in a couple of hours, I’ve got to go to the palace to see <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana</a>'. "His work was drawing him into that world. At first it was amusing, but as it drew on it became far more challenging for him.”</p><p id=ekwHe_osgxw data-wc=44>In 1996, photographer Anne Ray had been hired by <a class=hm-link href=#>The House of Givenchy</a> to follow him during the duration of his first collection for the French fashion house, when he succeeded John Galliano in becoming Head Designer at Givenchy, at the age of 27.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e06fee36aa49-gettyimages-1428868209.jpg><p id=eUjyJsPb6eq data-wc=49>“I took this photograph at the studio in the Givenchy building. A new British designer is arriving at Givenchy. From what we heard in Paris, he was supposed to be the new genius, or the new designer to watch. People were very curious in Paris about him,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=eH6q8idzB_b_ data-wc=73>“What is particularly funny to me about this picture, is to see Lee with his chubby face, Adidas top and sneakers in this very chic room. It was really a shock of cultures. Givenchy is a very traditional French couture house, Lee is very young arriving with his friends. They wouldn’t speak French, I couldn’t understand his cockney accent. Immediately I thought it wasn’t going to work. But, I loved him very quickly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35256cab14d8-gettyimages-96638378-612x612.jpg><p id=evFKjmVSBkJt data-wc=82>Ex-boyfriend Murray Arthur revealed a photograph of the couple with <a class=hm-link href=#>Helena Christensen</a> backstage at a show in Japan, in 1997. “He was invited to go to every party, but wanted to go home, have a takeaway and watch Coronation Street," he says. "His workload was so huge, he had a temper, a lot of anxiety, stress that was obvious and physical. Being involved in a relationship like that we had a lot of difficulties. And so we split up in March, 1998.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5b6c92f24175-gettyimages-83897166.jpg><p id=emX1jDYs3tS7 data-wc=43>Lee left Givenchy in 2000, allowing himself to work full-time at McQueen. “My survival there was to make my own work stand out and to pay people’s wages that worked for me. My heart was more in McQueen than it was in Givenchy.”</p><p id=ei1L89ESTtaG data-wc=43>Shaun Leane created jewellery for Alexander McQueen fashion shows for 18 years. “This picture conjures up so many emotions. It portrays our beautiful, very unusual friendship,” he says of the backstage shot featuring the pair at the AW04 'Pantheon as Lecum' fashion show.&nbsp;</p><p id=eafuIbiGaXp data-wc=12><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Kate's 11 best Alexander McQueen style moments of all time</a></p><p id=eVLFnkGVK5 data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The 11 best Alexander McQueen runway moments of all time</a></p><p id=evLjrnPGvu0T data-wc=88>“I love this picture because it has so much in it, it has us as friends, it has his mum in it, this lady in the front is his mum. We were actually looking at a piece that I’d made for the show, and Lee would always shout, 'mum come and have a look at what Shaun’s made'. His mum was at every show. And I saw a side of Lee that was so sweet, he turned into a little boy that wanted his mum to be proud.”</p><p id=eH4jUdQEfaH6 data-wc=39>Lee’s nephew Gary McQueen reveals a picture taken by his own mother, Lee’s sister, following the death of Isabella Blow in 2007. “This photo was taken just after Isabella Blow died. It's a very genuine, stripped-back version of Lee.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c479ab5405ab-gettyimages-74155215.jpg><p id=exHer4cZLQRK data-wc=41>“Lee was going through a down period at the time. And my mum and my nan went to see him in the studio. My nan suggested he go to the Isle of Skye to reconnect with nature. Just generally ground himself.</p><p id=ehsr0o6Bb1ny data-wc=70>“Everything had become about making money, but this was the total polar opposite of that world he was living in. This is stripped back to basics, so rugged and raw. He never looked easy in photos anyway, and I’m surprised he had these photos taken by my mum. But it was just them two alone. He felt protected around her. Someone that had unconditional love for him and she did.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e573a4616cb5-gettyimages-485437312.jpg><p id=egb-j7UNI77m data-wc=43>“He realised he needed to reconnect. During that visit he said to my mum, this is where I want to be buried. But Lee was like that, he was very blunt. But he meant it at that time and my mum knew it.”</p><p id=eYaPShii2Skj data-wc=49>Claire Wilcox, Senior Curator of fashion V&A Museum, explains how she started attending McQueen fashion shows in the late 1990s. "I was completely overwhelmed by it and I knew as a museum we had to represent and reflect what he was doing. And we followed his career ever after.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/838f3e88e067-gettyimages-465946676.jpg><p id=e6vupXZhMni0 data-wc=48>"Here was McQueen taking his bow after the ‘Horn of Plenty’ in 2009. And you can see McQueen here, looking pleased…but tired. Really tired. I just see someone who invested everything. This must have had a huge pressure on McQueen to produce commercially viable shows. He kept going.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c63a7dd5667f-gettyimages-85368054.jpg><p id=eapd_73-iYaz data-wc=52>“This particular collection was a striking satire in the fashion industry. It's about waste, things that are discarded and thrown away.” Lee says when interviewed after the show. “By challenging fashion you always need to be thinking that you have to challenge people’s idea of what is acceptable and what is not.”</p><p id=ekRIityIP7u6 data-wc=62>The final image was taken in 2008, by his nephew Gary. “The only evidence that exists between myself and Lee - the relationship between uncle and nephew. I never asked Lee to have a photo with him. I think he thought everyone wanted something from him, which is why I never asked for a photo. But I took this one from him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfae5cd0e465-gettyimages-1363496432.jpg><p id=e1TFjo6GUqNk data-wc=60>In 2022 Gary created a three-dimensional version of the shot. “He does look tired,” he says as the 3D image of his head rotated. “But probably mentally tired, more than anything. He was always fighting demons, which made him the person he was and great at what he did. But it is those traits that ultimately destroyed him as well.”</p><p id=eSl2kjiEvYr data-wc=6>Alexander 'Lee' McQueen: 1969 - 2010</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8WaqqGhn6N6tb7Ep5usZ2VmhHKFl2iYpZ2olrulsdFmpJyppZqyr3nToZxmpJmbsm6tzZ1kpZ2XlrC6ec6fZK2glWKzor%2FHoqanZZSawKqzzZ6pZqqVq7KiuMSdZKKmXamyr3nPopqtraKawHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cenk-uygur.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cenk Uygur Biography</a>
