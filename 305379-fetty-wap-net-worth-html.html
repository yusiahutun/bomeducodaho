This is easily seen through the type of vehicles he chooses to ride. His love for exotic <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">European motor vehicles</a> is common knowledge as seen in his collection that includes a BMW X5, BMW M6, and a Mercedes-AMG C63, not to mention the i8 coupe. He is one of the many celebrities whose love for BMW is evident.</p><p class=align-left>His 2016 BMW i8 is a beauty that almost all sports cars worth mentioning are. It comes with a gasoline-powered turbo engine together with an electric motor which is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. The hybrid system offers up to 357 horsepower and a 420 lb-ft of torque. When the power is combined with a curb weight of under 3,500 pounds, it is not surprising that this particular BMW i8 can reach a maximum speed of 155 mph as well as have an ability to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f4d9d730f69bc23e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How rich is Chief Keef?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As if that is not enough, the car is even more unique due to its Level 2 charging station which has the ability to power the carâs battery in a record time of two and a half hours. What this does is to allow the BMW i8 to attain an EPA-estimated fuel efficiency of 76 MPGe, while at the same time boasting of a total driving range of 330 miles. This type of fuel economy is impressive for a car of its kind and there will be no need for refueling every other time. The new BMW i8 coupe has a starting MSRP of $140,700. This can only mean that Fetty Wapâs bank account is not struggling at all since he is able to afford the car comfortably.</p><h3>Fetty Wap house</h3><p class=align-left>Fetty bought a new house with his girlfriend Alexis Sky.
