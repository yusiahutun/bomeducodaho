Checking out some of the best time travel movies on Netflix is a great way to do just that … and no time machine is needed!</p><p>“Yeah, I would love to be a time traveler.… It’s a fun construct, isn’t it?” The Notebook star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel McAdams</a> said during a panel interview for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">About Time</a>, her 2013 sci-fi romance film that lands in the mind-bending genre. “It’s an enticing thing to indulge and fantasize about. It’s like winning the lottery and thinking about what you would go back and do again.” Though the actress insisted there’s a beauty to just accepting your life and any past mistakes without going back to tinker with them, she did offer a heartwarming reason why she’d love to sneak into a time machine if she could. “My mother’s parents died when I was quite young,” she shared, “so I would like to be able to go back and know those people, as an adult.”</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Rachel McAdams Movies: Our 10 Favorite Films, Ranked!</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2_266dfa.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keanu Reeves</a>, Ted himself of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure</a> franchise, says he’d eye a couple of periods that are on his wish list. “I’d like to be there in the 1600s,” he shared with BuzzFeed, quipping that he’d always wanted to see “who really wrote the plays of Shakespeare…cause I don’t really think it was ‘Shakespeare.’ I’m an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford</a> [guy],” he noted, referencing a peer of the Bard, who some believe wrote the famous author’s plays and poems. He also expressed to Pedestrian TV a desire to travel back to “when the early globe, Earth, was formed,” so that he could get a taste of “that real first air, like, when it was really good.”</p><p>Taking in some deep breaths of pristine air alongside Reeves sounds pretty cool to us, and that’s the beauty of this genre: There are endless possibilities to imagine.

Captain Nova (2021): Best time travel movies on Netflix</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Kicking off the best time travel movies on Netflix is this Dutch entry (available dubbed, or with subtitles) is a great choice for family viewing. It won both Best Children’s Film and Best Dutch Children’s Film honors at the Netherlands’ Cinekid Festival. The story follows a fighter pilot from 2050 who travels back in time to save the Earth from environmental doom. When she arrives in the past as a child, though, she has to prove she’s legitimately on a serious mission and not just some wildly imaginative kid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. When We First Met (2018)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Family</a>’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Devine</a> stars as friend-zoned Noah, who turns to a magical photo booth to travel through time in the hopes of changing his status from platonic to romantic with his pal Avery (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexandra Daddario</a>). “I’m sweet and lovelorn, and someone your mom wants you to marry,” he told Collider of his role in the rom-com, which Decider says “is funny and not overly sappy and just weird enough” to deliver, promising that “The first chunk of the movie feels like something you’ve seen before, but once the time travel kicks into gear, the comedy does as well.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Real Life Movies on Netflix, Ranked: 10 Stories That Are Sure to Inspire</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10.

When he turns 40, however, he starts to notice that he’s lurching ahead a year in time with every hour that passes, which changes his whole perspective. “Each lurch forward brings him further from the people he loves … yet closer to the realization of what actually matters in life,” Deadline notes of this endearing dramedy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. In the Shadow of the Moon (2019)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>When a Philadelphia crime fighter (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boyd Holbrook</a>) starts noticing a wave of similarly disturbing killings every nine years, he becomes obsessed with cracking the case, which he’s convinced involves an evil time-traveling culprit. The film is “a tightly wound thriller with a surprising speculative element,” says The Verge, adding that it’s “constructed as a puzzle for viewers to unlock.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleopatra Coleman</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dexter</a>’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael C.

The story here follows a newly married procrastinator (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafe Spall</a>) who discovers that years are suddenly passing in minutes, and he must act fast to avoid losing the love of his life (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zahra Newman</a>). “There’s a truism that time moves faster as you get older so this is not a new idea but hopefully it’s a new way to package this morality tale about not wasting time and making the most of your moments,” Rafe told the Orange Country Register.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7.

NPR promises that it “admirably turns a potentially one-note joke into a consistently funny package. Better yet, it even manages to engender a twinge or two of heartfelt nostalgia for the most culturally embarrassing of decades.” As Cusack lovingly noted to Entertainment Weekly, “It’s a ridiculous film. You’re pretty much either sold with the title, or it’s not for you.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Best Sports Movies on Netflix, Ranked: Top 15 Films That Will Leave You Cheering</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. 13 Going on 30 (2004): Best time travel movies on Netflix</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Something has happened where all the kids who were 13 are now 30. All you guys have put the movie back in the zeitgeist, and it’s so sweet,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Garner</a> told PopSugar of her now classic film. As one of the best time travel movies on Netflix, this film follows a girl named Jenna who wakes up as her 30-year-old self (Garner) after suffering through her disastrous 13th birthday party. People calls it “an immensely likable” comedy that is “Garner’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Woman</a>.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Ruffalo</a> (with whom Garner re-teams in another film, below) and <a href=#>Judy Greer</a> co-star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5.

Fox cameo in this film that director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stefon Bristol</a> says was partly inspired by Back to the Future. The story follows a brilliant teen (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eden Duncan-Smith</a>) who uses a time-traveling backpack she invented to try to prevent the police from killing her brother. It’s “an all-too-real time-travel fantasy,” the New York Times notes of this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spike Lee</a>-produced project, which RogerEbert.com says is “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an ambitious, striking debut </a>that takes unexpected creative risks and heralds the arrival of an exciting new filmmaker.” The film was nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4.

The film has “this high-concept, wish-fulfillment engine behind it,” Reynolds told The Hollywood Reporter of its time-travel elements. “I lost four teeth during the movie,” Scobell reported of his own experiences traveling through time while filming, to which Reynolds quipped, “I just lost bone density.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Mirage (2018)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>When a woman (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adriana Ugarte</a>) travels 25 years back in time and saves a young boy, her own daughter is lost and a desperate struggle to save her begins. CNET calls this emotional Spanish film (available dubbed, or with subtitles) “the real deal,” noting it’s a sci-fi drama that hinges “on a time travel puzzle that’s resolved in a satisfyingly unpredictable fashion.” Thanks to its spooky concept and the story being partially set in the 80s, you may just pick up on some slight <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger Things</a> vibes while watching.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2.
