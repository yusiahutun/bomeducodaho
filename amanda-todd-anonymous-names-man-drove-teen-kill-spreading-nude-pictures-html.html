class=imageCaption>Tragic: Amanda Todd, 15, was found dead on October 10 after killing herself to escape cyber bullies<br></p><p><span>Anonymous has named a man it claims posted topless pictures of a 15-year-old girl online and harassed her so relentlessly that she killed herself.</span></p><p><span>Amanda Todd, from Vancouver, Canada, was found hanged in her home on October 10, just weeks after she uploaded a video to YouTube detailing her horrific treatment at the hands of cyber bullies.</span></p><p><span>When she was just 12, a man in an internet chat room convinced her to flash her breasts, and a year later, he </span><span>plastered a picture of the incident across Facebook.</span></p><p><span>Now in a vigilante move, Anonymous, the world's largest hacking group, has named</span><span> the man allegedly responsible for the picture</span><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span></span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The group claims that he is a </span><span>32-year-old from </span><span>British Columbia, but MailOnline has chosen not to identify him for legal reasons.</span></p><p><span>As Todd's supporters set up Facebook pages warning the man to 'sleep with one eye open', the move by Anonymous sparks concerns over its abilities to create a 'trial by internet' - bypassing the justice system and casting guilt.<br></span></p><p><span>In a video posted to YouTube by Anonymous, a figure claims the group lists his personal information, including his date of birth and address.</span></p><p><span>It explains that his username appears on websites where he 'blackmailed' and gave advice to young girls. The same username is also tied to a website with a 'jailbait' photo gallery.<br></span></p><p><span><span style=font-weight:700>Scroll down for videos</span><br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/16/article-2218532-1587975B000005DC-403_634x417.jpg height=417 width=634 alt="Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying was a 32-year-old from British Columbia" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying was a 32-year-old from British Columbia</p><p><span>'[He] is an abomination to our society, and will be punished,' the Anonymous figure says.</span></p><p><span>Referring to the possibility they might have the wrong man, they add: 'At the most this is the person who did this to Amanda Todd, and at the least it's another pedophile that enjoys taking advantage of children.'</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/13/article-2217109-157B5586000005DC-580_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Internet troll behind Reddit 'Creepshot' forum where users...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/15/article-2218189-1584DE1B000005DC-877_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Student, 13, suspended for standing up to school bully......</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/16/article-2218474-15871794000005DC-277_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Jeremy Clarkson names and shames 'moron Audi drivers' by...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/09/article-2215181-156CE822000005DC-795_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'We've all been victimized by this man': Deaf paraplegic...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p><span>Following Anonymous' announcement, the web moved swiftly, with groups calling for his death and warning him to 'sleep with one eye open'</span><span> cropping up on Facebook.</span></p><p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span>CKNW</span> </a><span>reporters have unsuccessfully tried to speak with the man, and neighbours have described his home as 'a known party house on the weekend with lots of young women coming and going'.</span></p><p><span>But police attended the home on Monday after a neighbour, Chyne Simpson, said Anonymous named the wrong address.
