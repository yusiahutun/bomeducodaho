Many may recall Travis’ horrific plane crash that took the lives of all on board except for the <a href=#>music</a> legend and his friend DJ Adam. However, his friend later died a year later, leaving Travis the sole survivor of the plane crash. Besides the tragedy, he has had more near-death experiences and serious complications that he managed to get through.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-barker-had-to-learn-how-to-walk-again-after-plane-crash>Travis Barker had to learn how to walk again after plane crash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1491640337-1024x683.jpg><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> was in a plane crash in 2008 that killed four of the six onboard. Travis and his friend Adam Goldstein were the only two survivors, with Adam tragically dying age 36 less than 12 months later.</p><p>In the horrific incident, which saw the plane catch fire before crashing at the end of the runway, saw Travis suffer third-degree burns. 65 percent of his body was burned, and he had to have 26 surgeries. The dad-of-three had to learn how to walk again and spend months in hospital.</p><p>More so, he was told he would never play drums again because of the skin grafts. But he pushed through.</p><p>He told Men’s Health in 2021: “As soon as I could walk, I could run. As soon as I could move my hands and my hands healed, I was playing drums. And now I’m in better shape than I’ve ever been.”</p><p>He didn’t get on another plane for 13 long years. It was his wife Kourtney who helped him muster up the courage to get back on a flight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-40-blood-clots>’40 blood clots’</h2><p>Blink-182 were forced to postpone their residency in Las Vegas after Travis was admitted to the hospital. He had found blood clots in both of his arms and was also diagnosed with a staph infection and cellulitis.</p><p>The Meet the Barkers alum said he had around ’40’ bloods clots in both his arms in June 2018.</p><p>Blood clots can be dangerous, especially if they <a href=# rel=nofollow>move to other parts</a> of the body, say the lungs. Once clots move to the lungs, pulmonary embolism, it can be a life or death situation. Thankfully, he was nursed back to full <a href=#>health</a>.</p><p>He told E! News: “I am recovering, I have blood clots.</p><p>“I have, I think, like 30 in my right hand and arm and I have about 10 in my left, so I’m just waiting for them to clear up. I’m on blood thinners.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-car-was-totaled-in-school-bus-crash>Travis’ car was totaled in school bus crash</h2><p>Just a month later, and he was involved in a car accident with his son and his son’s friend in the car.</p><p>A school bus ran a stoplight, according to the star, and totaled his car.</p><p>He managed to come out unscathed, and was in a 4×4 G-Wagon, which he believes saved his life.</p><p>“I was on the way to my son’s basketball game and a school bus ran a stoplight and totaled my car,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> US Weekly.</p><p>“It was pretty crazy.</p><p>“I’m really lucky everyone’s safe. Fortunately, there were no kids on the bus, just the bus driver. And my son and his best friend are all right.</p><p>“It was just more scary than anything.”</p><p>His son, 14 at the time, wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Life’s crazy…My dad, @carl.daw and I could have died today, our car was struck by school bus.. are car was Totaled thank god everyday because You never know if you’ll live to see tomorrow. 🙏🏽❤️”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-life-threatening-pancreatitis>Life-threatening pancreatitis</h2><p>The drummer was then rushed to hospital over a serious case of acute pancreatitis, with his wife Kourtney by his bedside.</p><p>He said at the time he was ‘feeling great’ went he underwent an endoscopy that day, but then took a turn.</p><p>“But after dinner, I developed excruciating pain and have been hospitalized ever since,” he said in June 2022.</p><p>He explained to fans afterward: “I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube.</p><p>“This resulted in severe life-threatening pancreatitis.”</p><p>“I am so very, very grateful that with intensive treatment, I am currently much better.”</p><p>Acute pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed, and one in five cases can be life-threatening, leading to multiple organ failure.</p><p>We’re glad Travis recovered well – but it appears he could be the luckiest man alive with the near-death experiences.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aAcMDRmq2iq12XrrO3xKtkoqtdqbWmecuumqShlajBbrnAp2SapJmrsm6txa2cq2WWlrCqusZmm56ZpJ16p7vUq2StoZ2awHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./georgiana-bischoff.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Georgiana Bischoff dating?
