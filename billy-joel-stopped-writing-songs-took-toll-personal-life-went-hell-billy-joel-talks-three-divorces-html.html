But when things didn’t work out, I never blamed my wife or myself,' said Billy Joel (pictured with&nbsp;his fourth wife Alexis)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We are backstage at Madison Square Garden, New York. Billy Joel is in a tailored suit and skull tie.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His gait is slow and deliberate. He’s a man with two new hips. Once on stage he’s exuberant and makes the giant venue feel like a living room – he holds the record for selling out 36 shows there in three years, more than any other artist.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The crowd itself is 20s up – younger than you’d expect. The front row is always pretty girls, he tells me.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I got tired of seeing these gold-chain guys with their babes sitting at the front going, “entertain me”,’ he says in a gnarly, Gangs Of New York voice.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘So I said, “To hell with this, the front row is not on the market.” I send my road crew to the cheap seats and they pick who they want in front – the cutest girls they can find. So we look down and see beautiful women. That amps it up.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Joel hasn’t produced any new music in 23 years, and on stage he says to the crowd, ‘At least you don’t have to listen to any new s***!’&nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-72ce1626c172f50c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/25/16/35A04A6F00000578-3656403-Billy_Joel_with_ex_wife_Christie_Brinkley_in_1983_Billy_says_By_-a-111_1466868822590.jpg height=619 width=634 alt="Joel with ex-wife Christie Brinkley in 1983. ¿She inspired the whole album [An Innocent Man] ¿ I went back to being a teenager again.

When it comes to Piano Man at the end, his voice is totally shot.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The audience sings it for him. And then he’s gone, taking a limo across town to the awaiting helicopter and on to his personal helipad at his home in Oyster Bay, Long Island, not far from where he was born.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A couple of days later I go there to meet him. It is like visiting the Gatsby home – beautiful beyond belief. A reconstructed Arts and Crafts mansion, sweeping views, manicured gardens and a pet cemetery. The bay is sparkling, with boats bobbing up and down in the water.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I used to work on oyster boats and look up at this house and hate the guy who was living here with his inherited money,’ he says, ‘and now it’s mine. Can you believe that? Oysters was all I was eating when I was on the boats. I had no money and had to get up at 5am in the middle of the winter.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Money isn’t something Joel needs to worry about any more – he’s worth an estimated $180 million, having sold more than 150 million records.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He takes me to the gazebo and points across the bay to a brick house.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘That was my old house, where I lived with Christie Brinkley.

She has his eyes. They can stare you out.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I grew up in a nothing place called Hicksville, Long Island, but I used to come here. This was a magic land, I’d ride my bicycle up and think “Wow”.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He’s 67 and he has an air of pride. He has a beautiful blonde wife, Alexis, 34, who gave up her job as a risk manager at Morgan Stanley so they could spend more time together and raise their child. With three marriages behind him, he’s anxious to do things differently.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Sure it’s different, but it’s different because of who she is. She didn’t have to give up her job, she wanted to. I wanted her to be around. She’s a good mate.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I’ve always taken out the trash and changed diapers. I don’t want staff around me. I want to walk around in my boxers if I feel like it. So we’re pretty much on our own. I do the cooking and she does the cleaning. It’s easy.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Does he have a signature dish?&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Yup, pasta. On a Sunday I make a big Sunday sauce, tomatoes, olive oil, garlic. Pasta is my downfall. I love to eat. My metabolism isn’t what it used to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Jack Nicholson once said the trouble with this country is all the guys with flat bellies and he’s right – there’s nothing more icky to me than a woman going out with a man and he’s picking at his food.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'A guy on a diet is not a guy as far as I’m concerned. I can even judge a woman I’m dating by how she eats. If she picks at her food she’s not going to be good in bed.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>I laugh wholeheartedly. How lovely to meet such an unpolitically correct star.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Joel has two rescue dogs – a fat pug, Rosie, and a boisterous mini pin mix, Jack. He shows me where his favourite dog, Sabrina, is buried and has a lovely memorial. She reminded him of his mother, who was his role model.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His German-born father left when he was ten and she raised him and his sister by working very hard and insisting that he start piano lessons. She died in 2014 at the age of 92.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I think once in a while you see them,’ he says. ‘The other day I thought I saw her.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He’s proud of his 12 best-selling albums and that his music speaks to people of all ages.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘How boring would it be if it was just people in my age group?’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His run at Madison Square Garden takes him up to the end of this year, and in the summer he has selective dates in huge stadiums, including Wembley in September.</span></p><img id=i-5d43a476e8f6e859 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/25/16/35A04A0F00000578-3656403-Billy_Joel_second_from_right_poses_with_his_band_in_1977-m-116_1466869222334.jpg height=418 width=634 alt="Joel (second from right) poses with his band in 1977" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>Joel (second from right) poses with his band in 1977</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I hesitate to call it a tour – I don’t want to be a road dog any more. I’ve got a new baby, a new wife and I don’t want to be in hotels.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Much is made of the fact that Joel doesn’t write songs any more. Does he have any secret ones lying around that one day he’ll finish?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘No. People can say I’m coasting, but I stopped wanting to write songs. It took a toll on me. Your personal life goes to hell in a handcart because you’re in a cave. All you’re doing is thinking about songs in your own hell. I hate writing but I love having written. I just stopped wanting to do it.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Elton [John] was always saying, “Why don’t you do a new album? Why don’t you write new songs?” And I would reply, “Why don’t you put out fewer albums?” I guess he wants to remain relevant, but if they don’t sell, what’s the point? I hate to think I’m a nostalgia act, but we all are, anyone who’s going to sell out arenas.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Elton and Joel toured together for 16 years, but a couple of years ago, Elton was quoted in the press criticising Joel, so why did they fall out? ‘We didn’t,’ he says (even though Elton said, ‘Billy is a conundrum and he’s got alcohol issues’).</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘That’s NOT the reason we’re not touring any more. I got tired of doing the same show over and over again and I think his agent told him we were going to do more dates that I never agreed to. I kept seeing in the press, “Billy cancelled the tour”. I didn’t cancel it; it was never booked. I asked him, “Why didn’t you call me? Don’t talk to my agent, talk to me.”</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I had to have my hips replaced and that was the reason I was out of commission. The last few gigs I did with Elton I could barely walk. I had canes – canes on stage is not good.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I have had drinking issues in the past. So did he. I think at heart he meant well.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Elton had said when he went to rehab in 1990 that he had to clean floors and criticised Joel’s rehab as not being hardcore.</span></p><img id=i-ac9c6f7a8ef86670 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/25/16/35A04A1F00000578-3656403-Joel_on_stage_in_1980-a-121_1466869683303.jpg height=780 width=634 alt="Joel on stage in 1980" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>Joel on stage in 1980</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘At one point he said I went to a rehab that allowed me to have a dog. I thought, “You weren’t in rehab with me, you don’t know what happened.” Once you go 30 days without a drink, you go OK, I get it. They dry you out. So I told him, instead of speaking these words, why don’t you write a few – because he doesn’t write lyrics.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Elton had a terrifying lifestyle when he checked into rehab. I didn’t have that problem. My drug was booze. A couple of years ago I went to a fundraiser for his Aids foundation and I said, “Don’t throw your friends under the bus.”’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Joel was born Jewish and baptised Protestant. Growing up, all his friends were Catholic. Now he’s an atheist. ‘If there was a God, it was Beethoven – he was the guy.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Both his parents liked music – they&nbsp;met when performing Gilbert and Sullivan&nbsp;in college but broke up when he was ten. His father went back to Germany, remarried.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘When my parents split up, my father went back to Europe and I never saw him again. Never got a card, nothing. He’d had a very rough life. Jews living in Nuremburg had citizenship stripped, businesses stolen by the Nazis. His family went to Cuba as there was a quota on Jews in America. When he first came to New York he got drafted into the army [during World War II].’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He shrugs. ‘I did miss having a father but it was a relief in some ways as my parents argued a lot and I was lucky as often the father wants his son to go into his business, or to go to college and I said I’m not doing any of that.&nbsp;I’m going to be a musician. My mother encouraged it. A lot of my friends were afraid of their fathers. I wasn’t afraid of anybody.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I took piano lessons when I was young and the piano teacher also taught ballet and the guys down the street would say, “Billy, where’s your tutu?” Bang, they’d sock me. So I went to the Police Boys Club where they did boxing.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Was he not concerned his fingers could be broken?&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘No, because I wasn’t that good a pianist and I’m still not. Rock ’n’ roll, OK, but classical, forget it! So the next time I got, “Where’s your tutu?” I decked them and nobody ever did it again. I stopped being frightened. I used to have a cute nose, but now it’s busted up.’</span></p><img id=i-c46fe1777e58f0f6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/24/15/35A04A2B00000578-3658517-image-a-7_1466778806085.jpg height=462 width=634 alt="With ex-wife Christie Brinkley in the video for Uptown Girl" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>With ex-wife Christie Brinkley in the video for Uptown Girl</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Has he never cared what people think of him? I read that he used to call reviewers who gave him a bad review.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘If someone has an opinion they can say, “In my opinion, I hated the music,” but if they were saying something that was not correct, I’d call them out. I don’t care about that any more. I’ve pretty much proven myself.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Is that the real reason he doesn’t write songs any more? He doesn’t want to be that guy who has something else to prove?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘No it’s not that. I’m still writing music, I just stopped writing words.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘When Christie [Brinkley] and I got divorced I was missing my daughter, who would visit me and then have to leave.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It was heartbreaking. I started to write what could have been a song, but the music was saying what I wanted it to say. It came naturally to me and it had all the emotion in it. Music speaks to me on its own. But I’ve never closed the door on writing songs.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Alexis, is Joel’s fourth wife. He married his first, Elizabeth Weber, in 1973, and she was the inspiration for She’s Always A Woman. They divorced in 1982.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘That divorce was a long, drawn-out affair,’ he says. ‘She was also the manager. She was protective of me, but it went to her head. It was not a smart arrangement.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It was in the wake of their break-up, on holiday in St Barts, that he stumbled upon the woman who would become his second wife.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘It was the first time I ever took a vacation,’ he says. ‘I started to play the piano in a bar, feeling blue because I’d just gone through the divorce and I looked up and there were Elle Macpherson, Christie Brinkley and Whitney Houston standing at the piano.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Whitney was only 16, Christie had a boyfriend and Elle was being flirtatious, so I started seeing her. Then she went to Europe to do the modelling thing. By that time I was already friends with Christie and she and her boyfriend broke up, so we started going out. I couldn’t believe my luck.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Famously, he wrote Uptown Girl for her.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘She inspired the whole album [An Innocent Man] really – I went back to being a teenager again. The rock star and the supermodel, that was a thing for a while.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'The hardest part of the break-up was being without my daughter because Christie moved to Colorado with some other guy and I’d have to fly to where they lived in blizzards. But after about a year she moved back to New York and everything was hunky dory.’</span></p><img id=i-15dba10383aa1b54 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/24/15/35A04A3B00000578-3658517-Billy_with_with_daughter_Alexa_Ray_-a-12_1466779458979.jpg height=406 width=634 alt="Joel with&nbsp;with daughter Alexa Ray.&nbsp;Alexa writes songs and plays the piano. ¿I don¿t know if she has the hunger or drive to make a career out of it.

I married Alexis when she was pregnant with Della Rose.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They met in 2009 at a local restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I was with friends, standing at the bar waiting for our table and here was this pretty girl. I started chatting her up and then we started dating.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'When she started to live with me I said, “Why don’t you quit your job?” Although I liked the businesswoman coming home in her business suit with a little attaché case. Kind of sexy.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Away from music, Joel is a keen biker, too, with his own motorcycle shop on Long Island and a sizeable collection of two-wheeled machines. Some years ago he ran into Bono in the Hamptons at The American Hotel.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘We got talking about music, shot the s*** and then he asked for a ride back. But he didn’t know how to get to where he was staying. I’d gone to the hotel on a little Vespa with a sidecar I used to take the dogs in. Bono went in the sidecar. We were driving around in Sag Harbour, a tiny place, and he still didn’t know where he was going. I said, “Give me some landmarks” and he says, “There’s trees and some water.” We were surrounded by trees and water. People were looking at me with Bono in the sidecar with an are-you-kidding-me? look. It took about an hour to find his hotel, which was five minutes away, but we had fun!’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We talk about his daughter, Alexa, who writes songs and plays the piano. She does cabaret at New York’s Carlyle hotel.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I don’t know if she has the hunger or drive to make a career out of it. If other people do her songs, that’s great. She’s scared of the music business because of the celebrity aspect of it. At one point she had a stalker. That scared her and she also doesn’t know how to deal with reviews.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘To be a good songwriter you have to feel everything, and when the slings and arrows come, it hurts.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'If I am afraid of something it’s not that, it’s about being old and infirm. I don’t freak out about it all of the time. But I don’t want to be so old I can’t think or do anything. I’d like to think you have a light switch that just goes off and then that’s it.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For now, he couldn’t be more full of life. But that’s not always been the case. After his third marriage broke up he was miserable and in pain, physically (from the hips) and emotionally. Was he also drinking?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Yeah sure. Some people take pills, some people go to a shrink, some people do yoga, some people drink too much. I drank too much after Christie, I drank too much after Katie. When you’re no longer in control, that’s a problem, I don’t like that feeling any more, I learned not to like it. Now I have a cut-off switch. I’m glad.’</span></p><img id=i-5f4aeaacc4ffe0d9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/24/15/35A04A8000000578-3658517-image-a-8_1466778813787.jpg height=420 width=634 alt="Joel's mansion in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>Joel's mansion in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When he was 21 he tried to kill himself by drinking furniture polish.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Nothing was happening with my music career, I didn’t have a job or a place to live. I had to live with my mum again, which felt like a real failure. So I said, “I’m going to kill myself.” There was stuff in the closet, bleach and another one called Old English scratch polish. I thought that looked tastier so I drank it and farted furniture polish for two days.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He did write a suicide note.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘And it became the lyrics to a song called Tomorrow Is Today. When you’re 21 it’s a tough age, that transition to adulthood. I keep reading that I suffer from depression, but I don’t.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Although he says he is not political, on stage he dedicated a song to Donald Trump – The Entertainer. Why was that?&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Trump is a strange guy – an inarticulate speaker, tortured syntax. I want someone who has eloquence, like Churchill. I never go into politics with an audience, that’s not what they come for.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Would he have cancelled his show like Bruce Springsteen did in North Carolina over the state’s legislation on transgender toilets, which says people can only use the toilet of the sex they were born with?&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I don’t think it’s going to change anything and it’s not the audience’s fault. Some people probably bought tickets in a secondary market and won’t get their money back. But I admire Bruce for taking a stand, he’s a principled man and a friend.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He’s also a fan of Coldplay and Adele, though he says: ‘I only listen to classical music now – Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It seems odd that he’s made his millions through rock music when the classical composers are his real passion. He is all about Beethoven and bikes.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘When I come to Europe I’m going to take a bike and ride.’&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He likes things simple. He believes in motorbikes and big pasta dinners. He does not believe in non-fat or new noses.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Maybe I should have had my nose fixed all those years ago but I never did. I’ve never been a matinee idol. I’m never going to get work done.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Changing my face isn’t going to make that happen. I’m a guy,’ he says. He doesn’t mean he’s just a guy, he means he’s a guy and everything that symbolises, and that too makes him happy. e</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-italic>Billy Joel plays Wembley Stadium on Sep 10</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCforJwsdWepa1nkafBqq%2FLnmRsbmVrgXF%2FjnugpaSpYpewsctmqq2noKWypXnWq6CtoZ6cerS7zaCqZqyfpLhuwM6lo2aolafAsLrApWSloZaaerixza1koZ2coXqDtculsGaCn5q5bsDApaKsZaSdv6axjJ2gr6eimLK0esetpKU%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./6590f527268e3e6c138b45c6-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Los conciertos ms esperados en Mxico en 2024: Luis Miguel, Belanova, Iron Maiden y ms</a>
