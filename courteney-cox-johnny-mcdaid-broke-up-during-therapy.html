"We broke up in therapy. I didn't know it was coming, whether I should have or not, it was just like we went to this therapist to talk about our boundaries -- what we could and couldn't accept about each other."</p><p>"Instead, he just broke up within the first minute," she continued. "And I was like, 'What?' And we were engaged. And I was so shocked. I was in so much pain."</p><p>The actress admitted that she is not a fan of surprises. "He's an incredible human being, so he wasn't trying to surprise," she explained. "He was in that much pain in the relationship. There was that much that needed to be dealt with that he had to protect himself around his heart."</p><p>Cox added, "So as opposed to like going 'F--k him,' getting in this mode of anger, I leant in and I did the most work on myself by far. I learned how to reclaim my voice, boundaries. What were my motives in life -- like, what was my part in this?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0832f041-a449-4369-bed0-9a321fca6c76 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6869d69f-89c3-40f1-8682-01ec3e83b641 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e9/5by4/2023/10/26/e9ec35a1bc7f42c8bffaa0abb3f96542_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Celebrities Who Played Matchmaker For Their Famous Friends</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Since the split helped her personally and in her relationship with McDaid, she said she's grateful that they briefly called it quits.</p><p>"I'm so thankful for that break-up," Cox explained, "When we got back together it was a different relationship, but also because it really taught me how I operated in the world. What were the things from my childhood that I needed? Like, whether it was to be adored by men or that I didn't know how to let go to be in a relationship. To not take things personally, ,y boundaries. I just went into myself and I had a great therapist."</p><p>The Scream actress said she continued to see the same therapist herself.</p><p>"I kept seeing him, the one that we met on the break-up day. And it was brutal to go to his office after that for a while," she recalled. "But then it was great. And I'm really thankful a) nothing will ever hurt me that bad again, and b) most of all, most importantly, I completely changed."</p><p>Cox and McDaid, 47,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> first began dating</strong></a> in fall 2013, and announced their engagement the following June. The couple reportedly ended their engagement in November 2015, before later reconciling in 2016. While they have been together since, they are still no longer engaged.</p><p>During her conversation with Driver, Cox praised McDaid's "bravery" to break up with her in that therapy session several years ago.</p><p>"It takes a lot of bravery to end something that has so much passion, or end anything," she explained. "Any kind of relationship. It's so much easier just to stay and ride things out and make excuses, and, you know, fear of pain is just too much to handle. But once you are bold enough to make decisions and go through the pain, you can't go around it. So just go through it, and then when you do everything's easier."</p><p>"I'm thankful that Johnny was so bold and brave because it was life-changing for me, and I'm sure for him," she added.</p><a id=gallery-link-7b4bf919-2fa6-435d-bf51-1f16503fe25d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:7b4bf919-2fa6-435d-bf51-1f16503fe25d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6869d69f-89c3-40f1-8682-01ec3e83b641 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/42/4by3/2024/04/22/42677e4a4a3f42bb87a4033d8fdecb12_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma21fmLy2vtOepZ6xXZi8uXnJqJ%2BnpqliuqSwwKKbZpqipLimedSpZJ2top67qHnToZyrmaCufA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./funds-raised-from-upcoming-bike-race-will-help-improve-qc-trails.html>&#171;&nbsp;Funds raised from upcoming bike race will help improve QC trails</a>
