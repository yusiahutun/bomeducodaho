class=mol-para-with-font>In August, LaBarbiera went to visit Harris in Florida to tour homes. He told her he was putting in an offer on their behalf at a condo complex - but no one under his name ever but in a bid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While Harris was staying in Florida to allegedly find their dream home, LaBarbiera sent him $12,500 for an <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-f3bf2820-c111-11ee-9fd3-d761ddf0a357>Airbnb</a> and $1,300 for entertainment - and he promised that his mother would pay her back soon. But she never saw the money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To put her mind at ease, Harris sent her an image of his bank statement, which showed a balance of $720,000. He texted her, promising to give her $10,000 in cash when he next saw her.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LaBarbiera kept sending him money, despite the fact that he was not paying her back. She sent him a total of $50,000 that month - as well as $6,400 for tickets to watch rapper Drake in concert.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Christina told the Real Deal: 'I was watching The <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-bbbebfc0-c10d-11ee-9fd3-d761ddf0a357>Tinder</a> Swindler and being like, these girls are so stupid.

My hope is that at some point, justice has to happen.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before she was about to fly to Florida, she got a frantic text from her boyfriend, saying that he had been pulled over and arrested. He asked her: 'Do you or anyone you know have $12,106 in cash that can be deposited into an account I give you.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'll call you the second I can but I got pulled over and they ran my stuff and apparently my restitution from the DV incident that charges were dropped, I don't have the answer right this second but someone didn't do their job and I've had an outstanding warrant for months now and had no idea I haven't been pulled over and when I have nobody ran my stuff.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to screenshots seen by the Real Deal, he then used that money to pay for an Airbnb he rented for his friend Matt.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then, he came with another request: 'They're hitting me up about the yacht, can you Zelle or wire that same account 4000 babe, when you pick me up Wednesday we can go to my place and give you cash from the safe.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Omg you're gonna see my place finally.

But by then, the gig was up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She confronted him over text several times - but he just responded: 'I'm sorry for all of this. For whatever it's worth. But everyone deserves peace.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LaBarbiera, an associate for Christie's, is described on her work website as: 'Born and raised in the industry, she spent many years working closely with North Jersey's highly respected real estate developers, LaBarbiera Custom Homes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She incorporates her marketing expertise and creativity in every aspect of her business.
