Julian is the son of American-Canadian musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer Robin Thicke and his ex-wife, Paula Patton. He was born on April 6, 2010, in Los Angeles, California, USA.</p><p>Since birth, Julian has been in the public eye and has attended various events with his parents. His father has collaborated with numerous artists, such as Nicki Minaj, T.I., Jessie J, <a href=#>Pharrell Williams</a>, DJ Cassidy, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Brandy, Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige, and even composed songs for Marc Anthony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Julian-Fuego-Thicke.jpg><p>This piece explores the life of Julian Fuego Thicke, what led to his suffering psychologically, and how he is doing presently.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Robin_Thicke_and_Paula_Pattons_Failed_Marriage_Affect_Julian></span>How Did Robin Thicke and Paula Patton’s Failed Marriage Affect Julian?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julian’s parents, Robin and Paula are former lovebirds that used to inspire their fans with their beautiful relationship. But unfortunately, they called it quits in February 2014 after nine years of marriage and over two decades of being together, stating that they had amicably decided to split.</p><p>However, months after their split, the couple got into a violent custody dispute for Julian, with the actress obtaining a temporary restraining order against the singer. Finally, in August 2017, they agreed on Julian’s custody, with Robin having him Monday through Wednesday and Paula having him Wednesday through Friday.</p><p>Julian would also alternate weekends with his parents, and they would split all costs and major decisions evenly. All this was happening while the boy was just 7. Julian allegedly endured emotional distress due to his parents’ contentious custody fights, prompting them to get him counseling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/robin.jpg><p>The then-7-year-old was hyperventilating, experiencing panic attacks, and behaving out, which greatly concerned his mother. Paula enrolled him in therapy to better understand his unpredictable behavior and seek treatment. Julian Fuego underwent family counseling with his estranged parents and individual therapy sessions during the divorce process.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Robin_Thicke_Physically_Abuse_Julian_Fuego_Thicke></span>Did Robin Thicke Physically Abuse Julian Fuego Thicke?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Julian had the luxuries his mother and father provided, he was subjected to unconventional discipline methods at his dad’s hands as he wanted to put his only son in check. During the custody battle, Julian reported to his school authorities that Robin spanked him more than once, leading to an investigation by the Department of Child and Family Services.</p><p>The singer who was interviewed for alleged abuse denied maltreating his son in court documents that <a href=#>read</a>:</p><p>“On a very rare occasion and only as a last resort, I will use light spanking, but it is consistent with the law — open hand on the butt. This is the type of discipline to which Paula and I agreed during our marriage.”</p><p>Speaking with <a href=#>Extra</a> in early 2021, Robin discussed getting help for his co-parenting relationship with Paula after their 2014 split, noting that in the aftermath, the “bickering” between the two was making the situation hard to navigate.</p><p>“We used co-parenting couples therapy, and that really opened the door for communication in a much better way for us,” he revealed. “And our son is thriving.” Robin added, “Nothing makes you prouder as parents when you had some tough times … figured it out, and your son is thriving because of it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robin_Thickes_Relationship_With_His_Son></span>Robin Thicke’s Relationship With His Son<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>R&B superstar Robin Thicke and actress Paula Patton’s son, Julian Fuego, seems destined to follow in his father’s footsteps. In 2022, <a href=#>Robin Thicke</a> shared an Instagram video of his then-11-year-old son following in his footsteps with some powerhouse vocals. In the clip, Julian is on stage with a choir, impressively singing the lead in a cover of Sara Bareilles’ “Little Voice.”</p><p>“My son Julian Fuego Thicke!” the “Blurred Lines” singer captioned the video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/julian-fotor-20230629225219.jpg><p>Many of Robin’s followers raved in the comments about Julian’s voice, writing, “Like father like son,” and “He has so much range and control at such a young age!!!!! Well done, papa!!!! #legacy”</p><p>Robin is often sharing his love for music with Julian. On The Jennifer Hudson Show, he spoke about how Julian has “got the gift” for music.</p><p>He says that Julian “started singing from a very young age,” adding, “I would give him whatever little pointers I could. He’s a natural singer.” Robin wants his son to “write his songs” and encourages him to be himself and love himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kt7a4yJqlZp6lmrSwedOhoJyjlWK6prHTZqmompmjerW0yJyinqtdqLyvedaiq6FlmaOws7HDopmlnV2iwrS1wpqjZqyRobKvwNJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./463021-muliro-gardens-kakamega-park-sheds-infamous-reputation-revamped-by-county-government.html>&#171;&nbsp;Muliro Gardens: Kakamega Park Sheds Infamous Reputation, Revamped by County Government</a>
