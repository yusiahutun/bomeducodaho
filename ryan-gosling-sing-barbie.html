She later reportedly backed out due to creative differences, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Then, in 2019,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robbie</a>&nbsp;was confirmed to be taking on the lead role of Barbie. “It comes with a lot of baggage,” Robbie told&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;in July 2023 of playing the iconic doll. “And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that comes a lot of exciting ways to attack it. People generally hear&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;and think, ‘I know what that movie is going to be,’ and then they hear that Greta Gerwig is writing and directing it, and they’re like, ‘Oh, well, maybe I don’t.’”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/oscarsdestinedtodissapoint.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ryan-Gosling-Im-Just-Ken.png><p>Gosling, meanwhile, got real about playing Ken at CinemaCon 2023 in April. “I have to be honest: I only knew Ken from afar before now. I didn’t know Ken from within. I doubted my Kenergy,” he said. “I didn’t see it, but Margot and Greta conjured this out of me somehow. One day I was bleaching my hair, shaving my legs and wearing bespoke pink outfits, and rollerblading down Venice Beach.” When it comes to whether Ryan Gosling sings in Barbie, here’s how it all went down.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=does-ryan-gosling-sing-in-barbie>Does Ryan Gosling sing in Barbie?</h2><p>Ryan Gosling does sing in Barbie but the story is sort of nuanced. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Music producer Mark Ronson</a>, who worked with Gerwig and Noah Baumbach on the original soundtrack for the film, wrote the words to “I’m Just Ken” but he was apprehensive about how the lyrics “Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility?” might be received by the director and producers. He certainly didn’t picture Gosling singing them. “When I sent the demo, I kind of mumbled that line, because I was like, if they don’t like it, I don’t want Greta and Noah to think that I’m trying to provide the funny,” Ronson told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Vanity Fair</a>. But Gerwig loved the words so much that she sent them to Gosling, who in turn was so enamored with the words that he wanted to sing them himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDBARB_WB065.jpg><p>Gosling was a Mouseketeer, so Ronson wasn’t worried about the actor’s ability to sing (he’d also shown off his vocal chops in La La Land) but Gosling’s “subdued baritone” gave Ronson pause. It turns out Ronson had nothing to worry about. “He really got [that] it had to walk this line of not being funny or parody,” he said. “But obviously, the song is also kind of ridiculous at times. So he was really amazing, and when he really did start hitting the big notes, I was like, this dude is a vocal powerhouse!” Ronson decided to “take it all the way” by bringing in&nbsp;Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash&nbsp;and new Foo Fighters drummer&nbsp;Josh Freese—who replaced the late Taylor Hawkins—to play on the track.&nbsp;</p><p>Barbie The Album&nbsp;features tracks from an incredible lineup of artists including&nbsp;Fifty Fifty, Charli XCX, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, PinkPantheress, Karol G, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Dua Lipa</a>, Lizzo,&nbsp;Ava Max,&nbsp;Dominic Fike,&nbsp;Khalid,&nbsp;The Kid LAROI,&nbsp;Tame Impala, HAIM&nbsp;and&nbsp;GAYLE.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=i-m-just-ken-lyrics>“I’m Just Ken” lyrics</h2><p>Doesn’t seem to matter what I do<br>I’m always number two<br>No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I<br>I have feelings that I can’t explain<br>They’re drivin’ meinsane<br>Allmylife been sopolite<br>But I’ll sleepalone tonight</p><p>[Chorus]<br>‘Cause I’m just Ken<br>Anywhere else I’d be a ten<br>Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blonde fragility?<br>I’m just Ken<br>Where I see love, she sees a friend<br>What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>I wanna know what’s there to know<br>To feel the real thing<br>Is it a crime if I’m hot when I’m in my feelings?<br>And is my goal finally here or am I dreaming?<br>I’m no dreamer</p><p>You might also like</p><p>[Bridge]<br>Can you feel the Ken-energy?<br>Feels so real, I guarantee<br>Can you feel the Ken-energy?<br>Feels so real, I guarantee</p><p>[Chorus]<br>I’m just Ken<br>Anywhere else I’d be a ten<br>Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blonde fragility?<br>I’m just Ken<br>Where I see love, she sees a friend<br>What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?</p><p>[Outro]<br>I’m just Ken and I’m enough<br>And I’m great at doing stuff<br>So, hey, check me out, yeah, I’m just Ken<br>My name’s Ken and so am I<br>And the heavy haired mind<br>So hey, check me out, I’m just Ken<br>Baby, I’m just Ken</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDBARB_WB053.jpg><p>Billie Eilish wrote “What I Was Made For” for the film and directed the accompanying&nbsp;music&nbsp;video explaining to Apple Music’s Zane Low the process of writing the song. “We truly sat down and Finneas started playing piano, and… those first couple lyrics, “I used to float, now I just fall down,” just came right out…”I used to know, but I’m not sure now what I was made for.”</p><p>She continued, “The start of writing this song, the first day of writing, Finneas and I, especially me because it’s from my perspective, we were purely only thinking about Barbie. I did not think about myself once in the writing process.” She then went on to say was so focused on the movie. “I was purely inspired by this movie and this character and the way I thought she would feel, and wrote about that.”</p><p>Billie said it was one of the most incredible experiences of her life. “The next week I was playing it in the car all day and playing it for everybody. And I was like, “This is exactly how I feel. And I didn’t even mean to be saying it.” It was truly the trippiest thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. I was like, oh, I absolutely was writing about myself, but I was thinking about myself from a third person. And I was thinking about myself objectively, which also made me feel really connected to her, me.”</p><p>Billie said she was stunned by the first&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>couple of minutes</a>&nbsp;she saw of the film when Gerwig invited her to an advanced screening. “A minute in, Finneas and I looked at each other like … Whoa, this is insane. She’d play a scene and she’d walk in front of us and she’d go, “So, in the next part, what I want it to be is I want it to really feel like this,” and she’d do her Greta Gerwig-ass thing and she’d come up and she’d show us her passion and tell us all,” Billie recalled.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=barbie-the-album-tracklist>Barbie The Album&nbsp;tracklist</h2><p>1.
