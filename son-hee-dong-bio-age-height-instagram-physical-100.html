Find out more about him as this article proceeds.</p><p>From here on, you’ll learn about his age, height, social media reach, and other additional information.</p><h3><strong>Son Hee-dong On Netflix’s Physical 100</strong></h3><p>Son Hee-dong is one of the contestants of Netflix’s Physical 100 in hopes to win 300 million won after completing a series of challenges.</p><p>The show is Netflix’s first Korean survival show. On January 24, the first two episodes on the streaming service were released, and a lot of viewers tuned in to see what it was all about. If the top 10 TV shows on Netflix are any indication, Physical: 100 is doing very well for itself. It is currently at No. 7 and doesn’t appear to be dropping off any time soon as of Jan. 26.</p><p>Jang Ho-gi is the creator of the reality competition program Physical: 100. There are nine episodes altogether, and each Tuesday, two new episodes are released on Netflix. The program follows 100 competitors with varying ages, genders, and physical characteristics. They engage in intense competition with one another to demonstrate their physical prowess and for the chance to claim the title of “most perfect physique.”</p><p>Of course, the winner will also receive a 300,000,000 (WON) cash prize. The cast includes members of the national team, weight lifters, actresses, bodybuilders, ice climbers, influencers, TV personalities, MMA fighters, and others from a variety of professions. In fact, you might be able to identify a few of the competitors.</p><p>The majority of the candidates on the show were eliminated in just the first few episodes. In the first episode, 100 competitors entered a room containing plaster casts of their torsos. However, 50 people were sent home after a short period of time. The candidates were divided into two groups of 50 and instructed to hang with their arms as long as they could while dangling above a pool of water for the first challenge.</p><p>The competition is still going on as Physical 100 episodes 3 and 4 are revealed to the public. The cast is scheduled to participate in “quest 2” in episode 4. After the 50 remaining competitors took a brief break, Quest 2 was revealed. Only 25 people will still be in the tournament after quest 2, which will eliminate half of the competitors.</p><p>Physical 100’s second mission is a team competition. Many of the candidates on the show were happy to be competing in a team match. Teams of five participants will compete against one another. To head each group, they had to choose ten team captains. Each candidate had to choose three teammates for their squad using a stamp.</p><p>Yun Sung-bin, Nam Kyung-jin, Kwak Myung-sik, Choo Sung-hoon, Tarzan, Kim Sang-wook, Ma Sun-ho, Jo Jin-Hyeong, Jang Seong-min, and Jang Eun-sil were the ten team leaders named following the voting. Yun Sung-bin received the most votes among the competitors.</p><p>On Physical 100, when the team leaders were chosen, the competitors were invited to line up in front of the leader they preferred the most. If there were more competitors than the allowed number, each team leader had to select 4 individuals to make up their team. As a result, many candidates ended up on teams they hadn’t intended to join.</p><p>As the least preferred candidate, Jang Eun Sil was forced to work with the majority of the team members who were not chosen by the other team leaders. She made the decision to offer her team’s best effort as she was the sole female leader among the 10 guys.</p><p>Leaders choose their opponents based on who received the most votes. Nam Kyung Jin decided to engage in combat with Jang Eun Sil’s crew as part of the same, shocking the latter. She said that she felt deceived because he had pledged not to oppose her. Kyung Jin, however, acknowledged that his team had a consensus and that he had to take it into consideration.</p><p>Kyung Jin and Eun Sil’s teams were the first to compete in the Physical 100 team quest. Both teams had to cross a bridge and fill a sandbox as part of the “Moving Sand” challenge. On the bridge, however, they are not permitted to exchange sandbags with one another. The group that moved the most sand in 12 minutes would win.</p><p>To announce his appearance on the show, he simply posted, “Coming soon 1/24 #Netflix&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>Physical100&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#netflix&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#physical100</a>.”</p><h3><strong>Is Son Hee-dong Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>We can’t say for sure about Son Hee-dong’s dating life.
