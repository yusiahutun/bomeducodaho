They don’t have to cost a ton of money, and they don’t require a ton of effort, either. All you really need is little thoughtfulness and pre-planning. Because if you think you can get away with going to (or worse, getting takeout from) the same boring restaurant every Friday night or spend all weekend sitting around watching Love Island for the fifth time with your boo, think again. Instead, spare a few minutes to brainstorm some great <a href=# id=auto-tag_date-ideas data-tag=date-ideas>date ideas</a> for you and your significant other to enjoy. You’ll have a great night and they’ll love you even more for getting creative.

You can pause the film to go to the bathroom, use your phone, and of course, make out stare-free if things get steamy.</p><h2>Scrapbook Your Personal History</h2><p>Whether your partner has a ton of baby pictures they want organized or you end up printing out the best of your college years from a Facebook album, you’ll have tons of fun <a data-pmc-sp-product=cdcf180e3c7496394144e400a3d36e52 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"scrapbooking together","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Vienrose Large Photo Album Self Adhesive for 4x6 8x10 Pictures Linen Scrapbook Album DIY 40 Blank Pages with A Metallic Pen","price":"17.99","id":"B07L4F224G","category":"Albums"},"id":237007,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>scrapbooking together</a> as you relive old memories and exchanged funny stories. It’s an intimate task, but also a great way to get to know someone a little bit deeper.</p><h2>Fantasy Vacation Planning</h2><p>This is definitely one for the long-time couples, y’all. Take some time to research your dream vacation, and lock in where you’d go, where you’d stay and all the activities you’d do. Then, put on your best salesperson face and try to “sell” the other person on your idea. Maybe it’ll just be for fun, maybe you two will end up booking your next trip!</p><h2>DIY Portrait Time</h2><p>Hang up a sheet, get some props from a dollar store, and have a little fun in your homemade photo booth! Get a disposable camera (or, better yet, an <a href=#>instant camera</a> for an aesthetically pleasing throwback vibe) and make an afternoon out of it. This is also a great way to ensure your partner ends up posting you on their IG feed, wink wink!</p><h2>Chef It Up</h2><p>Pick a family favorite dinner or dessert recipe and really try to nail it. Cooking together is an incredible bonding experience! Or, if you and your boo are more competitive, make the same dish separately and invite some friends over to decide who is the best chef, Chopped style. We’re rooting for you!</p><h2>Spa Day</h2><p>Pick up some fancy bath supplies or <a data-pmc-sp-product=8dc61b75c58da5340759766b2bc38443 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"massage oils","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Lavender Relaxation Massage Oil with Massage Roller Ball - No Stain 100% Natural Blend of Spa Quality Oils for Calming, Aromatic, Soothing Massage Therapy","price":"17.95","id":"B08LWYTPNB","category":"Massage Oils"},"id":237007,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>massage oils</a> , light some candles and try to find a copy of that CD every massage place has that’s just bird noises over Mozart. Bonus points for plush robes, cozy slippers and face masks!</p><h2>Become Bartenders</h2><p>Head to the liquor store (IRL or online) and pick up some funky liquors you wouldn’t normally go for. Then, go home and try to make each other a <a data-pmc-sp-product=7c82b80ce709938efeea391dfd772741 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"signature cocktail","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Cocktail Making Kit (4 Piece Gift Set) - Moscow Mule Kit, Gin and Tonic Kit, Champagne Cocktail, Old Fashioned Mix with Bitters for Cocktails with Recipes","price":"64.99","id":"B07SLHNRLW","category":"Bar Sets"},"id":237007,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>signature cocktail</a> or shot. Who knows, you might just whip up the drink that will get served at your future wedding reception! If your boo already is a bartender IRL, they’ll have a big advantage—but at least you’ll get to enjoy their drinks!</p><h2>Get Crafty</h2><p>Head out to a craft store and pick out the first kit that seems interesting. Spend a few hours painting models, making sand art, braiding friendship bracelets or trying your hand at sculpting. When you’re done, you’ll have a (probably bad-looking, but still sentimental) craft to remember your time!</p><h2>Indoor Scavenger Hunt</h2><p>Grab a pack of plastic Easter eggs (or any other small object) and label each with a compliment, secret or coupon for a service (You know the kind!). Hide them around your home and dare your date to find them all.</p><h2>DIY A Wine Tasting</h2><p>Stock up on some wines (some of your faves plus a few you’ve never tried before) from the store or an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">online alcohol delivery service</a> and pour them all into different glasses. Then, have your boo come over for an at-home wine tasting! Compare faves and see if you can’t find your new go-to date night bottle. Make sure to have charcuterie on-hand, too!</p><h2>Blind Taste Test</h2><p>Pick a category—water bottles, soda, fast food fries, chocolate bars, etc.—and buy multiple well-known versions. Then, have one partner try them all blindfolded and rate them or guess which is which. This might sound silly, but you’ll be surprised how into it you both get! Especially when you realize you actually hate the taste of your ~favorite water~ in comparison to the one you never buy.</p><h2>Take A Floral Arrangement Class</h2><p>You know how buying flowers for your partner is a cute thing to do? Booking a floral arrangement class is even cuter! You’ll both get to flex your creative muscles and you get to leave with two beautiful bouquets you designed. Make them for each other and compare skills at the end!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tim-collins-ojyua1g72aq-unsplash.jpg><h2>Take A Hike</h2><p>If you both love the great outdoors, grab your sneakers (or hiking boots, if you’re true pros) and set out for a day of adventure! Maybe you can even give one another massages later to soothe your tired muscles, wink wink.</p><h2><strong>Go On A Picnic</strong></h2><p>Head to Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s or your local market before the date and get some cheeses, breads, fruits and whatever else your little heart desires. Package it all up in a <a data-pmc-sp-product=95b1881b3c709517c5b6a67f4e8096ea href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"cute picnic basket","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Picnic Basket for 2 Wicker Picnic Sets with Insulated Cooler for Camping,Couples Gifts Wedding Gifts,Green-Stripe","id":"B09BZGBKVM"},"id":237007,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>cute picnic basket</a> or cooler, bring a cozy blanket or some beach towels and plop down to enjoy your feast at a local park. Major photo app alert.</p><h2>Take The Ferry</h2><p>If you live on a coast or close to water, chances are there’s a ferry nearby. While plenty of people use these big boats to commute, they also serve as a little mini cruise around your hometown, so have you and your partner dress up and make a day out of it! Make a point to grab lunch wherever the ferry docks before taking it a second time back home.</p><h2><strong>Wake Up Early For Sunrise</strong></h2><p>If you live by a body of water (or anywhere else where you can guarantee a great view), set an alarm for a little before sunrise and plan to both wake up. Put on your <a data-pmc-sp-product=00bcbe8af1d0b3a6f2e5565690f25c87 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"comfiest sweats","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Libin Women&#39;s Joggers Pants Athletic Sweatpants with Pockets Running Tapered Casual Pants for Workout,Lounge, Dark Grey M","price":"32.98","id":"B08T5V9C68","category":"Athletic Pants"},"id":237007,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>comfiest sweats</a> , hit up a coffee drive-through for something warm and energizing, and head to your special spot to watch the sunrise together. If you’re not early risers, you can try sunset instead!</p><h2>Food Truck Lunch</h2><p>Find out where the food trucks in your town gather and convince your date to try something new for lunch! Something about ordering your meal from a food truck feels so spontaneous and funky. Great date material!</p><h2>Hit Up A Roller Or Ice Skating Rink</h2><p>If it’s spring or summer, rent some skates and go to a local roller rink for tons of laughs (and, potentially, some athletic struggles). If it’s winter, Christmas-ify your date and go ice skating instead!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daniel-zjv8ptygceo-unsplash.jpg><h2>500 Days Of Summer It</h2><p>You know that scene in the movie where they go to Ikea and pretend they live there? Yeah, well we recreated it on a date once and it was honestly cute AF. This works for any and all furniture stores, people! You just need a partner that’s willing to lean into the gag.</p><h2>Literary Love</h2><p>Go to a bookstore, locate one (or more) of your all-time favorites and swap them. Find some comfy chairs, hunker down, and enjoy an afternoon discussing your picks. This is also a great date idea if you’re about to spend time apart. That way you can take your boo’s fave book on your trip, read it and discuss it when you return. Two dates in one, y’all!</p><h2>Fitness Sesh</h2><p>Taking a workout class together can be a great bonding experience! Or, if you don’t want to shell out the coin, you can use online videos and do it from home! If you want a little more ~togetherness~, might we suggest some acroyoga? Laughs are guaranteed.</p><h2>Smell The Roses</h2><p>Take your date to the nearest nursery (the plant kind, not the baby kind) or flower shop and soak in that light, humidity and plant smell as you wander. You can even pick up a small succulent or houseplant to remember the day.</p><h2>Woofin Around</h2><p>If you or your partner has a dog, making a day out of a dog park visit can be a fun way to get outside and enjoy each other’s company with zero dollars required. As a bonus, you’ll get to hang out with cute pups all day! You might even meet other couples doing the same and expand your circle for future double date opportunities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gilber-franco-wtyufk84i4k-unsplash.jpg><h2>Pop In For A Pop-Up</h2><p>Look up local events in your area and spend a few hours perusing! This can be anything from pop-up shops to temporary galleries to weekend farmer’s markets! Just going somewhere new (even if all you’re doing is browsing) elevates a standard date.</p><h2>Museum Crawl</h2><p>Look up obscure museums, or even popular ones you haven’t gotten around to yet. Try to fit as many as you can into an afternoon or just spend the day discussing one or two exhibits. Prepare to feel cultured as hell.</p><h2>Volunteer Together</h2><p>What could be better than doing some good with your boo? Volunteer at a local animal shelter or somewhere else you two decide on together, and dedicate the day to helping others. You’ll feel so great after!</p><h2>Support The Arts</h2><p>Find a community theater production of something that sounds interesting. Even if you aren’t theatre buffs, you might end up having a great time! If you can’t bear the thought of sitting through a two-hour play, try an improv comedy show or something else light-hearted.</p><h2>Go Back To School</h2><p>Find a community class for something that sounds interesting to you both—flower pressing, hot yoga, or creative writing. Building a skill together is a beautiful thing! Plus, if the class requires multiple sessions, you have more than one reoccurring date night lined up to look forward to.</p><h2>Shop Secondhand</h2><p>Outdoor flea markets are incredible date spots. Trust me! If you live together, check out some decor and furniture vendors and try to find something to spruce up your space. If you don’t want to splurge, set a max spending limit and challenge one another to buy a gift they think the other will love. Or, just grab a coffee and peruse together!</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>A version of this article was published in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imnykvsSaq6KulWKxosDEZqCdnZGoenN%2FlmlncGc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./breana-pitts-wiki-net-worth-wedding-husband-age.html>&#171;&nbsp;Breana Pitts Wiki, Net Worth, Wedding, Husband &amp;amp; Age</a>
