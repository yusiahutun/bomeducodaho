It started the journey from Ahmedabad in the State of Gujarat, India. Gradually, it re-branded itself as AMLEGALS in the year 2012. It is functioning as a multi-disciplinary, Specialised Law Firm. At present, it operates with its own offices in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and New Delhi. AMLEGALS operates in 14 cities of India through its associates and affiliates. AMLEGALS also has close international associates in China, Singapore & UAE.</p><p>In a candid talk with Ms. Easha Manchanda, Associate at the firm let’s get inspired from her journey towards success and what <a href=# rel=noopener>AMLEGALS</a> offers</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What were the initial challenges you faced?&nbsp;</h3><p>The challenge was expansion and going to new places but our commitment to services and results for the clients made our task easy to grow further.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Which was that point that triggered the growth of AMLEGALS?</h3><p>The trust of our clients encouraged us and triggered us to expand our work to new places. This has resulted in our growth which has taken us to places like Mumbai, Kolkata, New Delhi & Bengaluru.</p><p>Our growth is further projected with opening new offices in another 3 prominent cities in India by the end of the year 2021.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How have AMLEGALS graphs changed since the foundation?</h3><p>AMLEGALS started its journey with a small team in Ahmedabad and now has a PAN-India network of associations. We now have our offices operational in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and New Delhi. We have also marked our presence internationally through our associations across Asia.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is the reason behind your firm’s long-standing success?</h3><p>AMLEGALS focuses on the following :</p><p>i) proactive research-based advisory,</p><p>ii) non-litigation &</p><p>iii) highly research-based litigation.</p><p>We work with a fresh mind and hence prefer not to sit in the office after 7.30 PM on any working day. We deploy the best legal strategy so that the ultimate aim is achieved. We provide advisory & practice in every Indian law, with specialization. We deploy the blend of legal intelligence, research-driven hours, strategy, and intelligence to resolve and deal with every legal issue so that the ultimate aim is achieved. We strongly believe that quality, research, time, simplicity, and ethical standards have no substitute when it comes to legal issues.</p><p>Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day. It is the accumulative weight of our disciplines and our judgments that leads us to either fortune or failure.</p>Jim Rohn<h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the services AMLEGALS focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</h3><p>AMLEGALS provides legal services in the following fields of law:</p><li>Goods and Services Tax</li><li>Arbitration (both domestic and international)</li><li>Insolvency and Bankruptcy Laws</li><li>Litigation (Civil and Criminal)</li><li>Contracts</li><li>Intellectual Property Laws</li><li>Capital Markets</li><li>General Corporate and M&A</li><li>Direct Tax</li><li>White Collar Crimes</li><li>Advisory to e-commerce platforms</li><li>Competition and Anti-trust Laws</li><li>Energy Infrastructure and Resources Law</li><li>Insurance and Reinsurance Laws</li><li>TMT Laws</li><li>Defense and Aerospace Laws</li><li>We provide specialized legal advisory in all of these fields apart from all other Indian Laws.</li><p>We strongly believe that “strategy in law matters the most”. In law, building up a case is more important than simply fighting a case and which requires correct strategy, commitment, experience, expertise, capability, and an expert team to execute the same.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you decide to take AMLEGALS a step further in terms of your services?</h3><p>AMLEGALS strongly focuses on knowledge sharing and we actively work toward spreading knowledge within the legal fraternity, the law student fraternity, and to all our clients as well. <a href=#>AMLEGALS’ team firmly focuses</a> on research-driven strategies and all our advisory and services are backed by strong and reliable data derived from constant research.</p><p>We believe that there is no shortcut or substitute to hard work and our constant efforts and focused attitude are what will push us forward among the leading legal service providers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is there any new addition to the list of services? Anything exciting you would like to share?</h3><p>We always look for new laws as an opportunity and challenge to work on. We are front liners in GST, IBC, and recent in the list in data privacy laws.</p><p>Our motto is an attempt with challenges and put your heart and soul into every work to make it exceptional.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How have you seen diversity change over the years in the legal sector?</h3><p>Over the years, gender equality and diversity have been applauded in the legal sector. Say, 20 years from now there weren’t as many female advocates in the legal industry. Even if they were, there weren’t many holding prominent, influential positions. However, we see that a lot of women have come forward in the past couple of years and have established themselves in top leadership positions across our industry.</p><p>Men and women have together raised the bar in the legal fraternity by putting in constant efforts and hard work. The misconception that being an advocate is a man’s job is long gone and the current scenario has seen more and more women advocates coming across as leaders and having successful careers over the years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Can you please brief us about your professional experience?</h3><p>I have been associated with AMLEGALS from the inception of my career in 2018. My fields of interest include domestic and international Arbitration, Bankruptcy Laws, and Commercial Laws. I have been a part of several international and domestic arbitrations and have represented AMLEGALS across several Courts, Tribunals, and Judicial forums all over the country.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the key achievements of your journey in the law and litigation sector?</h3><p>It is my personal belief that in the legal profession, it is not a certain particular matter that can be considered as an achievement. Instead, the entire journey, in its bits and pieces is in itself composed of the several tiny achievements that make us the Legal professionals that we are.</p><p>In litigation, there is something new to learn from every single matter on each and every day. There is a new question that poses itself to every new point of law that we research. As legal professionals we cannot pride ourselves on triumphs in a certain matter; instead, we pride ourselves on the diversity and extent of knowledge that we possess and continue to learn every day.&nbsp; I consider this diverse and ever-increasing knowledge as an achievement in my journey of law and litigation this far.</p><p>Our motto is an attempt with challenges and put your heart and soul in every work to make it exceptional.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you look after your employees? What makes your team unique?</h3><p>We work as a team in every manner. We have set our own deadlines for work. We have various policies for our team which are not even deployed by tier I law firms in India.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is there any special experience with your clients you would like to highlight?</h3><p>We work as an extended legal team for them. We educate and maintain transparency so that the client doesn’t have to ask us rather they know what our next move shall be before every action along with the underlying pros and cons.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>According to you what next-generation women advocates and litigators should focus on?</h3><p>I believe that as women we often have to compete with a lot many things such as societal norms, gender-biased stigmas and we often have to limit ourselves gender-specific roles in our careers. As advocates, I believe women have the ability to change this and bring the change.</p><p>For that, we need to be the change we want to see and break out of the shackles of ‘what law and society have always been like’ and change that into ‘what we want our law and society to be like.’ So for the next generation of women advocates and litigators, I’d just like to shed some light on something Toni Morrison once said- “If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, you must be the one to write it.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>One person, who you admire the most?</h3><p>Mrs. Indra Nooyi. She served as the CEO of PepsiCo from 2006 to 2018, and over that time, the company’s revenue rose by 80%. She has been extremely outspoken about the struggles of maintaining the work-home balance as a leader of one of the world’s largest companies and has come proven herself to be a symbol of success for women everywhere.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Whose business story do you find the most inspiring?</h3><p>I find the business story of Mrs. Rashima Misra the most inspiring. She heads the role of Brand Development devising and implementing brand architecture framework in Milk Mantra, an Indian dairy Company based out of Orissa which was founded in 2009 and is one of the best examples of what a successful business venture looks like when it goes hand-in-hand with the empowerment of farmers of East India.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK6uuMSgmKWrXZqutLTAZqSappOdrq%2BwwGaYZqudlr%2B1ecuarrKdog%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bangladesh-sue-us-reserve-bank-after-suspected-chinese-hackers.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bangladesh to sue US reserve bank after suspected Chinese hackers stole US$100 million from it</a>
