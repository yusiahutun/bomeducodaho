Further, the actor has confirmed about living in the era o the first wave by staying away from all the social networking site and electronics. On an interview with Kjersti Flaa, he briefed about his habit and love for the fans.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Caption: Fans check! Alex dives in for wanting more connection with fans on a show with Kjersti Flaa (2016).&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, Alex kept his screen love within the screen and accordingly confined his relationship life. However in an interview with Young Hollywood, while promoting “The 5th Wave” when asked about believing in love at first sight in real life, Alex gave a green go in feeling it. He also disclosed about having his previously relation hooked by love at first sight followed by his first crush. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><strong>Caption: Relationship Alert!

Besides, the acceptance of having a date Alex has not disclosed anything about the woman nor about his current date, so there is a chance for him to be hooked or single.</p><h2>No Dates, Sincerely Dedicated Towards Work:</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>At an early age of 10 years, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alex</a> debuted in the movie industry from the movie “The Calling.” Since then, he has worked in several other movies and television like Sniper: Legacy(2014), Holby City(2011) and The Jury(2011). While currently, he has undertaken movie project “Rings”(2017) which has added more busyness refraining himself from getting indulge in dates.</p><p>Maybe since his early engagement in the film since childhood has made him focus on his career or may be due to his extreme busy hours, he has kept himself from the dating game. Well, with no much details and less interaction on the social sites, Alex surely has created an illusion on his current relationship status, so until and unless he clears the air we can say he's married to his career rather to a woman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqkla16s7vEZqOor12gsrp5y6KdnmWnlru1v4yfmKerXay1osCMsJinrJmjtG6zyKujn6qZmrulecyaqauhlZl6pK3RnpyrZaOeu6SxjJyfoqSUnbywsI2hq6ak</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meghan-markle-style.html>&#171;&nbsp;Best Meghan Markle Outfits - Meghan Markle Royal Duchess Style</a>
