She was the daughter of Larry and Donna Hearn. She was only 23 years old when she made her cruel and untimely demise.</p><p class=align-left>Karyn was married to Michael Slover Jr., and the two had a son called Kolten. However, since he was sometimes violent with her, she ended the <a href=#>marriage</a>. She was dating David Swann before she was murdered.</p><h2>What happened to Karyn Slover from Decatur IL?</h2><p class=align-left>On September 27th, 1996, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Karyn left work </a>at Decatur Herald & Review newspaper.

It also revealed that her body was dismembered using a power saw. Her boyfriend, David Swann, was the first suspect because he had some legal issues in the past. He cooperated with investigators and was cleared of the charges.</p><p class=align-left>In 1998 investigators implicated Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr. The broken concrete at Miracle Motors, Michael's <a href=#>business,</a> matched those used to weigh down Hearn's body. They also discovered that Karyn and her ex-husband's <a href=#>family</a> didn't get along.</p><p class=align-left>Hearn had won custody of Kolten in the divorce. However, the court ruled that her in-laws would have the right to babysit him while Karyn was at work. Karyn did not like it, which was the reason for their restrained relationship.
