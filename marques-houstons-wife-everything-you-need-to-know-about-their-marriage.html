Discover how she braved the odds to be his wife despite a public uproar about the relationship.</strong></p><p>Marques Houston is a well-known American actor and film producer, popularly known for his roles in “You Got Served” (2004), “Fat Albert” (2004), and “Sister, Sister” (1994). Besides his roles as an actor and movie producer, Houston is also known as the proud husband of the professional makeup artist Miya Dickey.</p><p>The couple married in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they share a daughter. So, who is Miya Dickey, and what has her marriage with Marques Houston been like these past years?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Marques_Houstons_Wife_Miya_Dickey></span>Meet Marques Houston’s Wife, Miya Dickey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Miya Dickey was born on October 7, 2000, and grew up in San Bernardino, California. Unfortunately, Dickey’s father wasn’t present in her life. However, her mother is, and the two seem to have a good relationship.</p><p>This shows in an Instagram post that Miya Dickey made in 2021. She <a href=#>wrote</a>, “My Beautiful Mom, my day one, my best friend, my venting buddy, my twin. Thank you, Mom, for giving me life. And thank you for our friendship; I hope to have the same relationship with my future daughter.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-10_5_57_16.jpg><p>In March 2021, Dickey revealed in an interview with Rolling Out that she lived with her grandparents as a teenager when she adopted the Jehovah’s Witness faith. Interestingly, several years later, her faith would play a key role in how she met her husband, Marques Houston.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marques_Houstons_Wife_How_They_Met></span>Marques Houston’s Wife: How They Met<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Houston and Dickey first met in April 2018 during a Jehovah’s Witness convention and bonded over their shared faith. They were introduced through Houston’s manager, Chris Stokes, and his daughter Chrissy Morales. Although the two met in April, they didn’t start dating until October 8, 2018, a day after Dickey’s 18th birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the public didn’t take kindly to the news because Marques Houston (born August 4, 1981) was older than Miya Dickey by 19 years. As a result, Houston was accused of several things, including grooming Dickey.</p><p>This led him to defend her and their relationship in an <a href=#>Instagram </a>post in June 2020, saying they were both adults when they started dating and that, most importantly, they had Jehovah’s blessing. Throughout the period the controversy was trending, Miya Dickey remained determined not to let the negativity get to her and chose not to comment on the matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-10_6_1_21.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Wedding_Amidst_the_Pandemic></span>A Wedding Amidst the Pandemic<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After five months of dating, Marques Houston proposed to Miya Dickey in March 2019. However, they had a private outdoor wedding ceremony a year later, in August 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Their wedding was filled with love and mushiness, especially from the actor. Speaking to PEOPLE, Houston confessed that he was incredibly anxious, to the point where his body trembled. According to him, he felt an overwhelming sense of perfection when he saw Dickey entering the aisle.</p><p>Houston said he couldn’t hold back his emotions despite declaring that he would remain composed. He ended up crying like a baby. Famous artist Major unexpectedly appeared and performed his well-known ballad “Why I Love You.” This particular song holds a special place in Dickey’s heart. More reasons for Houston to let a few more drops of tear go. It’s no doubt he loves his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-10_6_3_52-1.jpg><p>As expected, social media was awash with cute photos, well wishes, and mushy memories after the couple’s wedding. Perhaps, the mushiest of all was the one Houston shared himself in an interview with PEOPLE, where he described how nervous he was on his wedding day and how he and Dickey perfected a special handshake during the “kiss the bride part,” which they had practiced and failed to get right for five months before their wedding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marques_Houston_and_His_Wife_Have_a_Child_Together></span>Marques Houston and His Wife Have a Child Together<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marques Houston and Miya Dickey welcomed their first daughter, Zara Denise Houston, on December 2, 2021. The couple kept Maya’s pregnancy journey private. However, after the birth of their daughter, the former “Sister, Sister” star couldn’t help but gush about his fantastic wife in a heartfelt Instagram post.</p><p>He poured out his feelings alongside a stunning photo of Dickey from a pregnancy photoshoot. Houston marveled at the beauty radiating from her in a truly extraordinary way. He acknowledged the incredible power of a woman’s body to nurture and carry a tiny human. The actor lovingly referred to Dickey as his wife, rock, and even his “baby mama” with playful affection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-10_6_6_33.jpg><p>Marques Houston’s spouse often shares tidbits of her family life on Instagram, including her special moments with her husband and daughter. She shares her makeup, skincare, and hair routines with Instagram followers.</p><p>While the COVID-19 pandemic saw Marques Houston and Miya Dickey take their relationship to the next level, it also witnessed the sad end of other <a href=#>celebrity marriages</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2B0K6crGWYpMK0wM6nqmavmZuybrHVnqmyrJieu6h52KisZqaVmrFuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWStoJWev265wKupopmXmnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ruthie-henshall-reveals-playing-deliciously-amoral-free-spirit-roxie-appeals-big-stars-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;RUTHIE HENSHALL reveals how playing deliciously amoral free spirit Roxie appeals to many big stars</a>
