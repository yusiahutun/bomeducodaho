The secret to its success, says star <strong>Joan Van Ark</strong>, “goes back to [creator] <strong>David Jacobs</strong>’ phrase: ‘Dallas is about them. Knots Landing is about us.’”</p><p>Forty years after the nighttime soap began its run on December 27, 1979, Closer Weekly spoke with <strong>Michele Lee</strong>, <strong>Donna Mills</strong>, <strong>Ted Shackelford</strong>, <strong>Kevin Dobson</strong>, <strong>Don Murray</strong> and more to uncover the show’s funniest and most scandalous behind-the-scenes stories.</p><h2>How it All Began</h2><p><strong>Linda Gray</strong> (Sue Ellen, Dallas): I’ve got the scoop! David Jacobs pitched Knots Landing to CBS, but he didn’t know that [CBS head] William Paley sent a memo saying, “We want something big, like Giant.” So David, who’d never been to Texas, went back and pitched Dallas, and after it was a hit they said, “Anything you want, David.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/joan-van-ark-knots-landing.jpg><p>Joan Van Ark (Valene): It was going to be a Scenes From a Marriage thing where some couples had troubles, and some were crazy in love. He said, “I want to give [Dallas’] Val and Gary Ewing their own show.” The people who were part of it included <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>, <strong>Halle Berry</strong>….</p><p><a href=#><strong>Patrick Duffy</strong></a> (Bobby, Dallas): Larry Hagman and I did a few episodes for ratings, but we weren’t integral to the storyline.</p><p>Linda: I never went. I told them, “I don’t go to cul-de-sacs.” [Laughs]</p><h2>Shocking Moments</h2><p>Donna Mills (Abby): Knots was the This Is Us of its time. These were middle-class people with problems.</p><p>Joan: The times Knots was No. 1 in the ratings were when Val’s twins were stolen from her at birth, and when they were returned. I met <strong>Magic Johnson</strong> at a party and he went on and on about it in detail!</p><p>Michele Lee (Karen): That was my favorite arc — and when Karen had a drug addiction, at the same time Betty Ford announced her own problem. Mrs. Ford called me to meet her because I’d made a short film about Karen’s disease. She and President Ford were on their porch waving us goodbye and then we took our limo to McDonald’s! [Laughs]</p><p>Joan: My favorite cliff-hanger? When Jill [<strong>Teri Austin</strong>] forced a pound of sleeping pills down my throat because she wanted to get her claws into Gary. I raced to David’s office to say, “Is this your way of saying I’m out?”</p><p>Michele: I remember Karen was the first one to say “bitch” [on TV].</p><h2>Secrets From the Set</h2><p>Donna: Ted and I would be doing shower scenes and he’d always drop his towel. He thought it was really funny — he did it for years!</p><p>Ted Shackelford (Gary): I don’t think you could get away with that these days, but back then you did. That was a big shocker and great fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/donna-mills-ted-shackelford-knots-landing.jpg><p>Joan: What flashed in my mind was [guest star] Ava Gardner’s first day [in 1985]. There she is without a stitch of makeup in a man’s dress shirt. We are frozen in awe, and she says, “Let’s get to work!” [Laughs]</p><h2>Feuds or Friends?</h2><p>Don Murray (Sid): I was told by the producers that after I left [in 1981], things were not so happy between all the cast members for a while. But they got over that.</p><p>Kevin Dobson (Mack): I never experienced any feuds, other than those days on the set where it’s like, “I don’t want to go near that one today.” But we’re all human.</p><p>Joan: I better be careful, but I know Michele or Donna mentioned some [tension]. There were a lot of storylines that involved more Donna [than] Michele, so there might’ve been some [conflicts] there.</p><p>Ted: We had our ups and downs, but ultimately, we stayed up. I mean, it was great.</p><h2>Saying Goodbye</h2><p>Michele: Near the end of the show, they cut back money. We were doing extremely well, but everybody gets a raise every year, so they asked actors to only be on X number of shows so they didn’t have to pay them for every one. I told them I wanted to be on every show. And I’d do it for nothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/michele-lee-knots-landing.jpg><p>Joan: It was never really so over-the-top that it wasn’t believable until the later years, when they ran out of storylines.</p><p>Michele: David always said the only reason we were still on is that CBS forgot we’re on television, because it was thought of as a lesser “soap opera.” But we held our own, and we often beat the competition.</p><h2>Staying Close</h2><p>Donna: Joan, Michele and I are good friends and see each other often, and we see Ted fairly often. Bill [Devane], not so much, ’cause he’s kind of a recluse out in Indio, California.</p><p>Joan: We’re genuinely connected. Ted’s my best friend — I love, love, love him. I think that’s why it lasted 14 years. There wasn’t a bad apple in the group. We became a genuine family — that’s not just lip service. It was the truth, and it still is.</p><p><strong>For more on your favorite celebs, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to&nbsp;sign up for our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kpaiso2K5orrDoqWgZZOWwLV5y6impKtdl66kt4yopWasmJp6qq%2FOp6CcZaOav6qx0mZraWWpmq6zv4ylmK2domQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./burton-park-wanderers-fc-11-football-club-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Burton Park Wanderers FC: 11 Football Club Facts</a>
