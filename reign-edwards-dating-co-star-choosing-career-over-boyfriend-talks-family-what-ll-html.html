Let’s find out!</p><h2>Reign Edwards: Busy with Boyfriend or Career?</h2><p>Back in August 2017, Reign Edwards'&nbsp;on-screen love story was projected to Reign's dating affairs&nbsp;through dating rumors. She was rumored&nbsp;to be dating her "The Bold and The Beautiful" co-star, Rome Flynn on&nbsp;2017. Spicing the rumor, Reign shared an Instagram image of the duo marking&nbsp;the&nbsp;pair's lovely journey of two and a half years together on the show.</p><p>Though Reign quoted "Love you Roman" on the image's caption, the duo shared the good friendship rather than romance. Neither Reign nor Roman has addressed the dating rumors officially that will further support the rumors.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rumor does not seem to be true as&nbsp;Roman has frequently expressed the love and affection for another lady, Camia Marie with whom he shares a daughter, named&nbsp;Kimiko Flynn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Reign Edwards Talks About Family!</h2><p>Though Reign seems secretive about her love affairs, she is very much open to&nbsp;express her love towards her family. Back in&nbsp;November 2015,&nbsp;Reign gave an interview to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">soapcentral</a> where she was asked&nbsp;about her holiday plans and whether she would be traveling or not. She replied back hinting&nbsp;about her holiday plan with her family by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">saying</a>, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>"We're trying to figure out where we want to go right now. My mom and my sisters want to travel. We don't know where to yet, but I know time is running out! We've been talking about it for days, and we need to make a decision, but we don't know yet."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Reign, who has two sisters; an older sister and a younger sister, was further asked about the bond with her sister. Explaining the strong bond with sisters, Reign said,&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Yeah. My little sister is glued to my hip! The older sister is on her own doing her own thing now, but we still stay in touch -- obviously. But, yeah, family is very important to me, so I try to look out for my sisters and everything.</p><p>Evident from the interview, Reign is&nbsp;a "family loving girl" and&nbsp;loves spending time with them. Considering her&nbsp;busy schedule and responsibilities, she is more focused on her career rather than her love life. Presently, Reign Edwards is working on the TV series, "The Bold and the Beautiful" portraying the role of Nicole Avant in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Wiki-like Bio Of Reign Edwards:</h2><p>Reign Edwards, the beautiful actress, was born on Dec 1, 1996, in Hartford County, Maryland, the USA.
