Edens is the daughter of </span><span>Milwaukee Bucks owner, Wes Edens, who is also co-owner of the Premier League club, Aston Villa. Rodgers is also a minority owner of the Bucks. Edens is also a model and a social media influencer with more than 200,000 Instagram followers. She’s represented by Women Management LA, Ford Models and One Management. Rodgers and Edens were first linked in December 2022 when they were photographed together a Bucks game against the Los Angeles Lakers.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It’s more than friends, but it’s casual. Nothing serious at all,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in January 2023. “He’s not looking to rush into anything. It’s low-key for now.” The insider continued, “But it’s definitely a very close friendship that is evolving,” the source said. “He’s not going to do something as quick as Shailene [Woodley]. Live and learn.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=shailene-woodley-2020-2022>Shailene Woodley (2020 – 2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shailene-Woodley.jpg><p>Aaron Rodgers and Shailene Woodley dated fro 2020 to 2022. News broke of their relationship in February 2021. “They have kept things private and low key,” a source told <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a> at the time. The insider revealed that Rodgers and Woodley were in a long-distance relationship early in their romance because the NFL player lived in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he was “very focused on his [NFL] season.”</p><p>At the NFL Honors broadcast that month, Rodgers confirmed that he and Woodley were engaged after he thanked his “fiancee” in his speech. “It’s an honor to win this award for the third time. 2020 was definitely a crazy year filled with lots of change and growth, some amazing memorable moments. 180 straight days of having my nose hair scraped, playing for very little fans or no stands the entire season,” he said. “I got engaged.” A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that Rodgers’ friends weren’t surprised he was so quick to propose. “They are very happy together,” the source said. “It’s not surprising he proposed so fast. When you know, you know, right?”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2021, Woodley explained that her and Rodgers were able to keep their relationship a secret for so long because of the current health crisis. “You could travel, but you had masks on,” she said. “There was a sense of anonymity that otherwise I don’t think we would have had. We were really able to get to know one another the way we wanted to get to know one another and not have any noise or chaos around us.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> confirmed that Rodgers and Woodley had broken up in February 2022, a year after their engagement. “It was an amicable split; it just wasn’t working,” the source said. “They’re very different people with busy careers and there were obstacles that they couldn’t surmount. They will remain friendly; there’s no bad blood and no drama. It just didn’t work out for them.”</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">In Touch</a> at the time that the couple split because Woodley felt “neglected” by Rodgers in favor of his career. <span>“While Shailene is supportive of Aaron’s career, he put football first and they were barely spending any time together,” the insider said. “She felt he neglected their relationship. Neither of them was happy.” A second source also told In Touch that Rodger is an “independent guy” and “got cold feet” about his engagement to Woodley.&nbsp;</span>“[They] couldn’t make it work,” the source said. “There were too many obstacles. They’re both adults and decided to part amicably.”</p><p>Another source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> at the time Woodley and Rodgers hadn’t “been spending any time together” in the weeks up to their split because of how “focused” Rodgers is on his career with the Greenbay Packers. “Shailene has been super busy with work,” the insider said. “Everything was so different during lockdown, and they had been living in their bubble. Friends of Shailene didn’t believe Aaron is the best match for her.” A second source told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">magazine</a> that Woodley and Rodgers’ different interests also played a part in their split.</p><p>“They certainly had their differences and ultimately their relationship didn’t work,” the insider said. “They thought were a good match for each other in the beginning but the more they got to know each other they realized their careers, their interests [and] their political views weren’t aligned.” The insider also added that Rodgers is “very passionate about his football career,” which affected how Woodley felt in their relationship. “He was focusing more on the sport than on future plans with Shailene,” the insider said.</p><p>The split also came after a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in December 2021 that Woodley and Rodgers have a “different, non-traditional relationship.” The insider also denied rumors at the time that the couple had split. “Shailene and Aaron are still together. It’s not odd they don’t post about each other on their birthdays in that sense, and are very private about things,” the source said.</p><p>The breakup also came after Rodgers, who previously claimed that he was “immunized,” came under fire in November 2021 after he tested positive for COVID-19 and revealed that he was actually unvaccinated.&nbsp;“I realize I’m in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now, so before my final nail gets put in my cancel culture casket, I think I’d like to set the record straight on so many of the blatant lies that are out there about myself right now,” he said on The Pat McAfee Show at the time. “First of all, I didn’t lie in the initial press conference. During that time, it was a very — witch hunt that was going on across the league, where everybody in the media was so concerned about who was vaccinated, and who wasn’t, and what that meant, and who was being selfish, and who would talk about it, and what it meant if they said it was a personal decision.”</p><p>He continued, “Had there been a follow-up to my statement that I had been immunized, I would have responded with this: I would have said, ‘Look, I’m not some sort of anti-vax flat-Earther. I am somebody who is a critical thinker.’ You guys know me. I march to the beat of my own drum. I believe strongly in bodily autonomy and the ability to make choices for your body.”</p><p>During the interview, Rodgers claimed that he didn’t get vaccinated because he’s “allergic” to an ingredient in the Pzifer and Moderna vaccines. (He didn’t specify the ingredient.) He also noted that he opted against the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because he had “heard of multiple people who had had adverse events” after they received the vaccine. ESPN also reported at the time that Rodgers asked the NFL about “alternate treatments” he could have instead of the vaccine.</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in January 2022 that Woodley and Rodgers have “agreed to disagree” on several topics including politics. “They are not talking about their politics, and they never really have,” the insider said. “They disagreed on a lot of things. Early on, they decided to agree to disagree about things and not debate them.” The source continued, “She is not someone whose mind you can change, so Aaron hasn’t even tried.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=danica-patrick-2017-2020>Danica Patrick (2017 – 2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Danica-Patrick-Aaron-Rodgers.jpg><p>Aaron Rodgers was first linked to professional racecar driver Danica Patrick in December 2017. In an interview on Jenny McCarthy’s SiriusXM show in May 2018, Patrick recalled how she met Rodgers at the 2012 ESPY Awards. “We both remember meeting each other, it was quick,” she said. “I got his email address and I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh, not a phone number? Just an email address?'” In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in 2019, Patrick revealed whether she and Rodgers had talked about marriage. “Look, there’s no guarantees in life, but as long as you have that intention, that’s what matters, right?”</p><p>The two bought a $28 million mansion in Malibu, California, together in 2019 before their split the following year in 2020. In a statement to Us Weekly in July 2020, a representative for the racecar driver confirmed that Patrick and Rodgers were “no longer together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=olivia-munn-2014-2017>Olivia Munn (2014 – 2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olivia-Munn-Aaron-Rodgers.jpg><p>Aaron Rodgers and <a href=# id=auto-tag_olivia-munn data-tag=olivia-munn>Olivia Munn</a> dated for three years from 2014 to 2017. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in June 2017 that Munn was the reason for Rodgers’ estrangement from his family, including season 11 Bachelorette winner Jordan Rodgers. “Aaron is the one that has pulled away from the family, not the reverse,” the insider said. “When he got together with Olivia Munn, his family told them they didn’t trust her and thought she wasn’t with him for the right reasons. That made him furious, and he ended up choosing Olivia over his family.” Munn and Rodgers split in 2017.</p><p>In an interview with SiriusXM’s Radio Andy in 2018, Munn shut down rumors that she was the reason Rodgers was estranged from his family. “Before he and I started dating, he hadn’t spoken to the parents and one brother for, like, eight months before we started dating,” Munn said at the time. She continued, “They had a really nice conversation, then they started coming out my first year when I was in Green Bay in 2014. I just think it’s really important to try to mend things in a family, and I encouraged that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jessica-szohr-2011-2014>Jessica Szohr (2011 – 2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-Szohr.jpg><p>Aaron Rodgers was first linked to the Gossip Girl alum Jessica Szohr in 2011. The two split soon after but reunited for a short time in 2014. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> at the time that Rodgers and Szohr first broke up due to their busy schedules. “They broke up because her schedule was crazy for a while and they just couldn’t stay together in that situation but now they have been spending their free time together and things feel good,” the insider said. “They fell right back into it.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
