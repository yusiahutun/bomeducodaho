And he continued to churn out the world-class performances on his European Tour debut in Belgium, over the weekend.</p><p>However, in his semi-final clash with Pikachu there was an incident after Littler checked out to earn a spot in the final. Pietreczko furiously pulled in a confused Littler and barked something into the 17-year-old's ear.</p><p>The German has now continued his rant on Instagram, posting on social media: "Well, I really appreciated being in one of those [games where] dude can play a game like that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32322779.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_luke-littlerjpeg.jpg> Buy dart stars signature collections here <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Luke Littler Loadout SP</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32185375.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_sp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The dart set includes a 90% Tungsten straight barrel 52mm in length, featuring radial grooves for enhanced finger grip.</p><p>The 26mm Black Swiss Point, utilizing Swiss Point Technology, allows for easy point switching, and its flush integration with the barrel adds to the set's sleek appearance.

This England v Scotland rivalry was intense.</p><p>Bristow, also known as 'The Crafty Cockney', usually won against Wilson, beating him 16 times out of 25. But whether he won or lost, Bristow was never very nice about it.</p><p>The 1983 BDO Grand Master final was a moment to remember, where Jocky Wilson was left feeling embarrassed both on and off the stage. In an interview before the game, Bristow provoked Wilson by proudly stating "I played him here two years ago and I beat him 5-0."</p><p><b><i>What's your favourite tense incident? Let us know in the <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>comments section</a>.</i></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32022636.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_littler.jpg><p>He was just as arrogant after winning, boasting about his "bloody marvellous" play despite being booed by the crowd. He even pointed at one fan and said "If brains were taxable you'd get a rebate'."</p><p>Thankfully, after their careers ended, the two of them started to get along. When Wilson sadly died in 2012 after being sick for a long time, Bristow came to his funeral.</p><p>He told reporters that "Jocky and I were enemies when we played but we always shook hands and went for a drink after and he always won that." Six years later, Bristow passed away too, but their legacy as some of the first big stars of darts lives on.</p><h3>The Power and Barney</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32185411.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_sp.jpg><p>Phil 'The Power' Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld have also had their moments, with both of them once being the top two players in professional darts. One day, a clash between them was bound to happen.</p><p>Before their semi-final match at the 2013 PDC World Championship, 'Barney' angered Taylor by saying that he wasn't scared of him, to which Taylor suggested the opposite.</p><p>After winning 6-4, 'The Power' celebrated in front of the Dutchman and appeared to misunderstand his attempt at a friendly hug.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32185441.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_sp.jpg> <span class=factbox-header><h3>Luke Littler darts fans can back 'The Nuke' in Premier League with his playing shirt</h3></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32185464.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_sp.jpg><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Luke Littler fans</a> can now buy the 17-year-old's playing shirt to support him as he continues to demonstrate his talent in the Premier League.</p><p>The darts sensation was only 16 when he wowed Alexandra Palace at the World Darts Championship (WDC), despite a final loss to Luke Humphries.</p><p>The Nuke will continue playing against seven of the best dart players in the world — Humphries, Michael van Gerwen, Gerwyn Price, Michael Smith, Nathan Aspinall, Rob Cross and Peter Wright — in a mini-tournament in a different city every Thursday until the final in May.</p><p><a href=# title="Target Darts" rel=nofollow><b>BUY LUKE LITTLER'S SHIRT HERE</b></a></p><p>This resulted in an unpleasant exchange and Taylor, who went on to win the final and claim his 16th and last world title, later felt compelled to say sorry.</p><p>He admitted: "Raymond's a big lad and he has a strong handshake, and when he pulled me, it hurt me. I reacted wrongly and I'm ashamed of that because I really like Raymond I'm gutted about what happened."</p><h3>Worsley goes too far with MVG</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/sport/darts/article32325016.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_eric-bristow.jpg><p>Playing slowly, distracting opponents, blocking - these are all common reasons for arguments between darts players. However, it is unusual for players to nearly fight over clothing.</p><p>This occurred during the 2014 PDC Winter Series when Jonathan Worsley was criticised for wearing a shirt that didn't meet the dress code after claiming he'd spilled drink on his original top.</p><p>Instead of accepting the warning, Worsley responded by accusing Michael van Gerwen of having someone marking for him dressed in jeans and a T-shirt - also against the rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31715367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Jocky-Wilson.jpg><p>The argument escalated to the point where Worsley pushed van Gerwen and was thrown out of the tournament as a result. Not done there, he would later brand 'Mighty Mike' a "f****** cry baby" on Facebook.</p><p>While van Gerwen himself admitted to frequently calling Worsley a "rat' during their altercation. It all gave the event ample publicity – albeit for the wrong reasons.</p><h3>Lewis exits stage left</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/sport/darts/article32325015.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_raymond-van-barneveld-and-phil-taylor.jpg><p>Listing every spat involving Adrian Lewis would merit a book in its own right, but arguably, his first major flash point still represents his most dramatic.</p><p>Five years before he won his first PDC world title, 'Jackpot' made it to the quarter-finals where he faced Peter Manley, and became infuriated by what he perceived as mind games from his opponent.</p><p>Trailing 3-1, and having been goaded by Manley one time too many, Lewis reached breaking point and stormed off stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32076403.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Darts-2014-William-Hill-World-Darts-Championship-Day-Thirteen-Alexandra-Palace.jpg><p>A rowdy crowd lapped up the hilarity of the situation, and referee Russ Bray had to fetch the then 20 year old Lewis from the backstage area. Manley would later admit he overstepped the mark, and smoothed things over with Lewis by taking him out for dinner.</p><h3>Anderson aghast at farting accusations</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32023689.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_202324-Paddy-Power-World-Darts-Championship-Day-Sixteen.jpg><p>As accuses for sporting defeats go, 'my opponent was deliberately breaking wind' is up there with the most unique of them.</p><p>That's what happened two years ago though at the Grand Slam of Darts, when Wesley Harms accused Gary Anderson of leaving "fragrant smells" which duly affected his concentration.</p><p>Anderson, who won the match 10-2, denied the heinous allegation, hinting it should be Harms deemed responsible. "I had a bad stomach once on stage before and admitted it. So I'm not going to lie about farting on stage."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/sport/darts/article32325018.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_gettyimages-1197015929.jpg><p>"Every time I walked past there was a waft of rotten eggs so that's why I was thinking it was him." The serious sincerity with which Anderson spoke made the whole affair as strange as it was amusing.</p><p>Gerwyn Price has revealed he paid a heavy price for his angry walk-off at the World Darts Championship. Gerwyn Price, the current world champion of darts, has had his fair share of disagreements with other players.</p><p>His most intense rivalry is with none other than Adrian Lewis and Peter Wright. But this time, it's not about any strange smells. The feud started at the 2018 Grand Slam of Darts final. Price was trailing 11-8 but managed to turn things around and win 16-13, securing his first major PDC title.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32143530.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BetMGM-Premier-League-2024-Night-Three-OVO-Hydro.jpg><p>However, the result doesn't tell the whole story. It was a heated match, with both players clashing repeatedly. Anderson wasn't happy with Price's slow play and over-the-top celebrations.</p><p>The crowd seemed to side with Anderson, booing 'The Iceman' Price throughout the game. Despite this, Price went on to win.</p><p>He was later given a suspended ban and fined £12,000 for his behaviour during the match. Judging by Anderson's reaction when he lost to Price in the 2020 World Championship final – where he didn't even congratulate him – it's clear that there's still bad blood between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Oaqa2rX5mus8DSZpmin5eawLV5xZ6snatdoba1wMueqWaomaCupLTUZmpra2JqfXN8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./endangered-sex-boosting-seahorses-given-lifebuoy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Endangered sex-boosting seahorses given a lifebuoy</a>
