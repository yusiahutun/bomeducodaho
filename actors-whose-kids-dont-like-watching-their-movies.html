While many celebs are proud to showcase their hard work to their children, a lot of these stars say their kids are the hardest people to impress. In fact, many famous offspring don’t like watching their parent’s movies at all. Although it may be disappointing that their children aren’t interested in watching their mom or dad on screen, these celebrities are keeping their fingers crossed that their kids have a change of heart one day.</p><p>Here’s what these celebrity kids had to say about their parent’s movies…</p><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a></p><p>Ben Affleck’s three kids don’t have any interest in watching his movies so he has a hard time getting them to watch anything he’s been in. Out of the flicks he has convinced them to watch, Ben says they’ve only liked "Armageddon" -- but still make fun of him for it.</p><p>"It's funny because that's the one movie of mine that my kids have watched and they'll kind of all admit to liking, even though they relentlessly mock it and me. 'What are you, driving a tank on the moon?' But they had fun, you know what I mean? They won't even watch ‘The Town.’ So there you have it," Ben told <a href=#>EW</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:57d21f87-a665-4d23-8b76-f60c04f57f60 data-container-ref=toofab:article:aa8d6580-f653-416b-8b31-350d5af23607 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/5by4/2022/07/17/eb8942b93c724e018328c2e7fbe7d225_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">OnTheJLo.com</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez Got Married In Vegas -- See All the Photos!</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Alexa PenaVega</strong></a></p><p>"Spy Kids" may have been a staple in many people’s childhoods, but star Alexa PenaVega says her kids aren’t fans. In fact, they much prefer "Sharkboy and Lavagirl," a film that a lot of fans incorrectly believe Alexa also starred in.</p><p>"Everybody thinks I was Lavagirl. I was not Lavagirl, but my kids only watch ‘Sharkboy and Lavagirl.’ They don't like ‘Spy Kids.’ Kingston keeps telling me that I should have been Lavagirl," Alexa told <a href=#>E! News</a>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Adam Sandler</strong></a></p><p>Adam Sandler’s children may not be old enough to see the majority of his movies but they have seen a few of his PG-13 flicks. He explained that his daughters begged to watch the films but when he finally allowed them to see a few, they ended up hating them!</p><p>"They begged to see them. They’re like, ‘Please, it’s not fair. Let me watch your movies. Those people always yell things at you on the street and I don’t know what the heck they're talking about.’ So I show them the movies they demanded and every time, I’d say about 20 minutes in, I see them tuning out, and then I hear them. They’re nervous to say it, but they’re like, ‘Can we watch something else?’" Adam said on "<a href=#>The Ellen Show</a>."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:71ad7138-4d38-40c1-8f4f-443385881c6b data-container-ref=toofab:article:aa8d6580-f653-416b-8b31-350d5af23607 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ee/5by4/2022/06/07/ee92ee2c366a449eb638dcd5f7b9c3ae_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Adam Sandler Reveals Accident in Bed Left Him 'Bleeding Terribly', Nude Beach Encounter in Spain</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Idina Menzel</strong></a></p><p>"Frozen" is beloved by children around the world but Idina Menzel’s son has no interest in the movie.

The actress says her daughter Apple thinks it’s "weird" when she’s on screen and has chosen to not watch any of Gwyneth’s movies.</p><p>"My kids have never seen me in a movie.

The only exception they’ve made is for her recent film, "Jungle Cruise."</p><p>"This, interestingly, has been the only trailer that they have watched multiple times.

In fact, Courteney says Coco doesn’t like watching any of their movies but she just might force her to watch the latest "Scream" flick.</p><p>"She’s seen part of ‘Scream 1’...She doesn’t like to watch anything we do…I’m gonna make her watch [‘Scream 5’] with her eyes open," Courteney told <a href=#>Extra</a>.</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Matt Damon</strong></a></p><p>Matt Damon says that his children don’t like watching his films, particularly his 15-year-old daughter Isabella. He says she often pokes fun at his work which helps keep his feet "firmly on the ground."</p><p>“You know, my 15-year-old refuses to see [‘Good Will Hunting’].
