Other rarer causes include kidney failure or genetic disorders.<br></p><p>The dairy farmer spent all his savings trying to get treatment before some sympathetic surgeons at a specialist clinic in Beijing took pity on him. They removed his breasts in a five hour operation for free.</p><p>However, the doctors are still baffled over what caused his breasts to balloon in size to such a degree.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/09/article-1301515-00A109AA000004B0-271_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Fury in China as female babies grow breasts after drinking milk laced with hormones</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/09/article-1301469-0ABB0A85000005DC-943_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Nice tanned tum, Simon Cowell, shame about the moobs</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p>Dr Zhang Lilan at the Jinan Chest Hospital in Beijing, said: 'In my 30 years working here at the chest clinic I have never seen anything like it.</p><p>'We wondered if he had eaten any poisons or contaminants but have found nothing after testing his blood.

They would ask her if I still had anything, you know, down there. They told her at 40 she still had time to get another man.
