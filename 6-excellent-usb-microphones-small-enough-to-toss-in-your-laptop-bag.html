lackluster microphone can be frustrating to say the least---both for the person using it and the people who have the displeasure of listening to it. You might want to upgrade to a dedicated microphone for clearer audio, but that doesn't mean you have to deal with a complicated bulky setup. Here are the best small USB mics you can buy today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>USB microphones are ready to use out of the box, sound great, and can come in surprisingly small packages. Whether you just want to step up your game for your next video call or you finally want to start that podcast you've been planning, there are plenty of mics that deliver on quality sound while keeping a compact form factor.</p><h3 id=update-3-1-22>UPDATE: 3/1/22</h3><p>Verified picks and links still good.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-a-microphone>What to Look for in a Microphone</h2><p>Most of the microphones on this list are condenser mics. This is the most common type of USB microphone, and there's a lot to consider when choosing out which one to buy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Audio Quality:&nbsp;</strong>This is the most important part of any microphone, but it's hard to gather how good or bad a microphone sounds just from its spec sheet. If you want to hear how a microphone sounds for yourself, your best bet is looking the microphone up on YouTube and watching a couple of sound tests.</li><li><strong>Software:&nbsp;</strong>There's a lot you can fine-tune about a microphone to make it sound just right. This is typically done through software provided by the manufacturer. The more options the better, but the program needs to remain easy to navigate as well.</li><li><strong>On-Device Controls:&nbsp;</strong>Just because a mic comes with software doesn't mean having on-device controls is useless. Being able to adjust your volume (or gain as it's technically called) or mute yourself all together with a dial or button is extremely useful in a pinch.</li><li><strong>Headphone Jack:&nbsp;</strong>Many microphones feature zero-latency headphone jacks. These allow you to monitor the input that's going from your microphone to the computer, which is useful if you're recording your voice and want to ensure everything sounds right. Usually, microphones that include this jack will also have a dial for adjusting how loud the headphone output is on the microphone itself.</li><li><strong>Polar Pattern:&nbsp;</strong>Simply put, polar patterns are the area around a microphone where it picks up sound. There are quite a few patterns, but the most common ones are cardioid, which mainly picks up sound directly in front of the mic; super-cardioid, which is similar to cardioid but it has a narrower area; and omnidirectional, which picks up noise from all angles.</li><li><strong>Sampling Rate and Bit Depth:&nbsp;</strong>These both have to do with how much data the microphone is recording. The sampling rate and bit depth standard (commonly called "CD-quality" audio) is 44.1 kHz and 16-bit, respectively. Anything above that is considered "high-definition audio." This isn't something you need to be too concerned with if you're just joining voice calls, but if you're recording your voice or streaming, it's worth noting. All the microphones on this list&nbsp;record at the standard CD-quality at the very least.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-overall-blue-yeti-nano>Best Overall: Blue Yeti Nano</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/f3ccdd27-4.jpg> Blue<p>The original <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Blue Yeti</a> is one of, if not the most popular USB microphones around. It's the microphone of choice for many YouTubers, podcasters, and streamers, and pretty recently Blue compacted that great tech into the adorable Nano. It's even still capable of the 48 kHz high-definition sound that the original Yeti accomplished, with a higher bit depth of 24-bit compared to the original Yeti's 16-bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering the size difference between the Nano and the original Yeti (the Yeti Nano is about three inches shorter than the original), it's remarkable how great the Nano sounds. Like the Yeti, you can install Blue's <a href=#>Sherpa software</a> to adjust the gain and sampling rate to your liking. The Nano can also switch between cardioid and omnidirectional polar patterns with the button on the back of the mic or by using Sherpa. Also on the back of the microphone, you'll find a zero-latency headphone jack for monitoring---there's also a headphone-output volume dial on the front.</p><p>The Blue Yeti Nano is available in four colors: Shadow Grey, Vivid Blue, Red Onyx, and Cubano Gold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/41t56tmxaol-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Logitech for Creators Blue Yeti Nano Premium USB Microphone for PC, Mac, Gaming, Recording, Streaming, Podcasting,Condenser Mic Blue VO!CE Effects, Cardioid&Omni, No-Latency Monitoring-Vivid Blue</h5><span>Best Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>A compacted version of one of the best USB mics around.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Best Buy</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Lenovo</a><h2 id=best-budget-option-fifine-k669b>Best Budget Option: FIFINE K669B</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/156005c5-4.jpg> FIFINE<p>Just because you're on a tight budget doesn't mean you can't get great audio. The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">FIFINE K669B</a> delivers on some great audio quality for the price and is more than enough for voice or video calls. Most reviewers cite this microphone as being pretty sensitive though, so if you want to use it for recordings, you'll likely have to edit out some background noise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no software for the K669B, but the stock settings should be fine for most situations (16-bit, 48 kHz with the cardioid polar pattern).

They are extremely similar to each other---in fact, specs-wise, they are effectively identical. The only difference of note is that the Wave 3 offers an impressively high sampling rate of 96 kHz, while the Wave 1 goes with the more standard 48 kHz (they both have a bit depth of 24-bit). Both record using the cardioid polar pattern and have zero-latency headphone jacks for monitoring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking at the outside, the microphones look extremely similar,&nbsp;but the Wave 3 is slightly taller than the Wave 1 (0.4 inches taller to be exact). The main physical difference between the Wave 1 and Wave 3 are the dials on the front of the microphones. The dial on the Wave 1 only adjusts the headphone-output volume and can mute the mic if you push it in. The Wave 3's dial can switch between multiple modes (gain adjustment, headphone-output volume, and mixing the PC and microphone audio) by pushing the dial. There's also a dedicated mute button on the top of the Wave 3.</p><p>Another big draw to either of these mics is <a href=#>Elgato Wave Link</a>. This is Elgato's audio-mixing software specifically created with streamers and the Wave microphones in mind (although it also works with non-Elgato microphones). You can use it to balance the audio of up to nine sources, whether that's the Wave 1 or Wave 3, your game volume, or other programs like <a href=#>Discord</a>. There's also the "Clipguard" setting in Wave Link, which automatically balances your audio to avoid peaking. Because of all this and its simple design, Wave Link is extremely useful to streamers looking to improve their overall audio setup. Wave Link is also where you can tweak the settings on the Wave 1 and 3, such as the gain and sampling rate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Wave 3 costs a bit more than the Wave 1, with the main advantage being the fancier dial. But at the end of the day, these microphones are going to sound extremely similar to each other, and because Wave Link was designed with both in mind, streamers can't go wrong with either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/31giowdniql-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Elgato Wave 1</h5><span>48kHz Sampling Rate</span><p class=display-card-description>A terrific and affordable microphone for new streamers.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$165 at Amazon</a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/41nzhaoa1dl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Elgato Wave:3 - Premium Studio Quality USB Condenser Microphone for Streaming, Podcast, Gaming and Home Office, Free Mixer Software, Sound Effect Plugins, Anti-Distortion, Plug ’n Play, for Mac, PC</h5><span>Built for Streamers</span><p class=display-card-description>A great mic with great software.

However, that's just talking specs, more notably, the Emote has a pixelated LED display on the back of the microphone. This display can show off little animations and pictures, either built-in by default or ones you make in Razer's <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">streamer companion app.</a>&nbsp;(You still use <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Synapse 3</a> to adjust the audio settings.)</p><p>This software also allows you to integrate the mic with your stream, so you&nbsp;can have certain emoticons show up on the mic depending on what your chat says, for example. Of course, that doesn't improve the microphone functionally speaking, which can make the significant&nbsp;price increase from the Seiren X hard to swallow.

The clasp is attached with an adhesive strip, but don't worry, it won't leave any residue behind if you decide to take it off. There are also three additional strips included in the box if you want to switch the headphones you're using. (You can also <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">buy more</a>&nbsp;of these strips if you need to.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of the size and build, the ModMic is more comparable to headset mics than desk mics. It may not sound as good as the mics we've already covered, but the ModMic still sounds great for a headset and is more than enough for voice calls.</p><p>There are two versions of the ModMic: wired and wireless, the latter of which uses its own USB-A adapter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/31ujknl7wyl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Antlion Audio ModMic USB Attachable Noise-Cancelling Microphone with Mute Switch Compatible with Mac, Windows PC, Playstation 4, and More</h5><span>Headphones to Headset</span><p class=display-card-description>A small attachable microphone that turns any pair of headphones into a headset.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/211wixqptpl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Antlion Audio ModMic Wireless Attachable Boom Microphone for Headphones - Compatible with PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Any USB A Type</h5><span>Cut the Cord</span><p class=display-card-description>A wireless version of the ModMic</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$140 at Amazon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhrcG1jbXx3ecSxmp6knJq7tXnUrJlmpZmYv7C8x6ilnqtdqLqiuMtmnKenpZy1bsDOZquoq6Nitq952Kisq2Wclr21u89mmZqfXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./actress-elizabeth-mitchell-married-divorce-husband-family-plastic-surgery-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Actress Elizabeth Mitchell's Married Life: Divorce with her Actor Husband and Family Issues</a>
