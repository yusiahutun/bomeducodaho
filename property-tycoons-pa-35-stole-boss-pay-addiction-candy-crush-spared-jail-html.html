Estates, before she was caught.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Esfandi is behind the sale of some of Britain's grandest homes, including £65m Athlone House on the edge of Hampstead Heath in

company named Dwyer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She began employment in February last year and she had a duty to maintaining his diaries as well as managing personal finances and business finances.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'As part of those duties she was given access to Mr Esfandi's online financial accounts, the company profiles and also a credit card of an ex-employee which she was instructed to cancel. That card was not cancelled.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Mr Esfandi became concerned about some transactions that were made on business credit card there were also inconsistencies, namely transactions that weren't tallied up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Some of these transactions have been investigated and in total £11,500 worth of transactions were made which were not authorised.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They are purchases on an iTunes account for applications such as Candy Crush.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He had a conversation around September with

criminal offence down to simply the depression or the bad things that have happened.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She acknowledges it was her privileged background which contributed to her offending,' said Ms Duong.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This is someone who has expressed remorse at an early stage and has tried to engage not just with what she did but also on a detailed level.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She did make genuine attempts with the police to try to identify which transactions she was responsible for.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said Johnson, who is now jobless, wished to apologise to her former employer and intended to repay him everything she stole.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She is fortunate to have the support of her partner who is able to loan her the sums of money to repay it,' added Ms Duong.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Judge Joanna Korner said: 'Looking at you in the dock I have no doubt you appreciate the seriousness of your position today.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It is a serious offence when those in positions of trust and responsibility abuse that trust and responsibility, as you did for a number of months in the last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When your employer entrusted you with the use of company credit cards and you used it to buy luxury goods for yourself.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the judge decided to suspend Johnson's sentence due to her early admission and 'obvious remorse'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Johnson, who appeared in court wearing black trousers and a black blouse, fought back tears when she heard she would be spared jail.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was given a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, with a 150-hour unpaid work requirement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Johnson, of Chiswick, west London was also ordered to pay £8,830 in compensation as well as £350 in costs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She admitted one count of fraud by abuse of position.</p><p class=postsid
