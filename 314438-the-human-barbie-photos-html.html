Here are some photos that she took before surgery that prove that Valeria has significantly transformed over time.</p><h3>1. At the beginning</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/522e520119204eec.jpg><p class=align-left>Valeria Lukyanova was born on 23rd August 1985. Her parents are Irina and Valery Lukyanova. When she was a small child, everyone marveled at her beauty because she had big and doll-like eyes. She was naturally beautiful from a very young age.

She was drawn to the perfect plastic look of the Barbie doll and the airbrushed appearance. Even though this was pretty normal for any little girl, the obsession that she had with the dolls was unusual. It was the obsession with Barbie dolls that played a major role in the decision to transform her look later on in life.</p><h3>3. The darker days</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a6e91818795d8ee1.png><p class=align-left>As a teenager, Valeria was very spiritual. As a young woman, Valeria practiced witchcraft. She was a gothic who used to wear all black and perform some spiritual rituals. Even though she has grown out of the dark days, she is still very spiritual.</p><h3>4. Valeria Lukyanova, the beauty queen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4dd42d6b16ce0317.jpg><p class=align-left>Valeria began modelling during her late teens and early twenties.

Most of her fans are asking what does the human Barbie doll look like? Here are some of the human Barbie doll latest photos that she posted this year.</p><h3>1. Dolling up</h3><p class=align-left>Valeria Lukyanova has for the longest time denied that she went through plastic surgery to get her current facial and body appearance. The only surgery that she says she has gone through is breast augmentation. Critics and plastic surgeons seem to think otherwise after a close scrutiny of the changes in her appearance before and after she assumed the Barbie doll look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cbba40306a8524a0.jpg><p class=align-left>Valeria might have undergone more surgeries than she claims. They assume that she has had a nose job, brow lift, cheek and neck reduction, shaved jaw line, liposuction on her limbs, scooped-out shoulders, breast lift, and a sculpted tummy tuck to become a human Barbie. The above photo clearly shows that Valeria's dream of becoming the human Barbie now has come true. She possesses all the characteristics of Barbie doll including the tiny waist and flawless skin.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e895bd8ce9cb10ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blood Ties telenovela cast, episodes, full story, how to watch</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nollywood star Tonto Dikeh reveals she underwent plastic surgery to achieve hourglass figure</p><h3>2.

The above photo reveals what is hidden underneath the makeup. Valeria without makeup is very different from the Barbie character that she has been creating. She loves her natural look, and posts regular photos of herself with no makeup on. As you can see from these photos, she still looks beautiful with no "Barbie makeup" on.</p><h3>3. Working out at the gym</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6986b7aa9bc3891c.png><p class=align-left>So how does Valeria maintain her body so that it continues to look lean and thin?

Well, she tried to live on a diet of air and sunshine but things did not go well for her. However, she still dreams of trying to live like a breatharian again some day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c546ffa95becf1bd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Raquel Welch then and now photos: A journey of beauty and defying age</span></p></a><h3>4.
