Here’s the truth about Judd’s first husband.</strong></p><p>Arch Kelley III became famous due to his connection to American country music singer Wynonna Judd. However, regardless of what made him famous, Arch is originally from a successful American family with a history.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arch_Kelley_III_Early_Life></span>Arch Kelley III Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arch was born on March 23, 1931, in Dickson, Tennessee. He is currently 92 years old. Arch is of white ethnicity, but nothing is known about his upbringing except that he was raised by his parents, Arch Sr and Pearl Potts, alongside his two siblings, Lean and Claudia Kelley.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c6e56effd59f2508e818dda2f538d0ed-fotor-20230619234858-2.jpg><p>Despite his fame now, gathering information about Arch’s family background is still difficult as he is very private. Little information is available on his educational background. However, we believe whatever he studied in the university will be related to business since he is known as a businessman asides from being Wynonna’s ex-husband.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Arch_Kelley_III_Wynonna_Judds_First_Husband></span>Was Arch Kelley III Wynonna Judd’s First Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes. But the story of how Arch met Wynonna isn’t known. However, based on the report, we believe Arch first saw Wynonna in 1993. The duo were first friends before they became lovers. They dated for a while before Arch eventually asked Wynonna to marry him. They got married on January 21, 1996.</p><p>Theirs was a private wedding with only close family members and friends. Sadly, Arch didn’t hold the title of Wynonna Judd’s first husband for long, as their marriage crashed two years later. They separated and got divorced in 1998. The reason for their short-lived marriage isn’t known to the public till today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arch_Kelley_III_Children></span>Arch Kelley III Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arch and Wynonna’s first child, Elijah, was born on December 23, 1994. They had him while they were still dating.</p><p>Their second child was a baby girl born six months after their wedding. They named their second child Grace Pauline Kelley. She was born on June 21, 1996, making her just two years younger than Elijah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/46364aa768b5ccd0f6b1d30f9c446979-fotor-20230619235446.jpg><p>Both children were born in Nashville, where they spent most of their childhood. While nothing is known about Elijah’s whereabouts today, we know Grace got into trouble with the law.</p><p>Grace has been in and out of prison since 2015 for drug-related offenses.&nbsp;In May 2017, Grace pleaded guilty to cooking and selling meth.&nbsp;Originally, Grace was sentenced to 30 days behind bars, followed by a court-mandated rehab program. However, she left the treatment early, leading to her arrest and subsequent sentencing.</p><p>Grace was sentenced to eight years in prison in November 2017, with possible parole in 2019. Luckily for Grace, she was released six years early. According to her criminal record, she was granted parole, which will last until 2024. The controversial story surrounding Grace has led many to wonder how deeply her parent’s divorce and her mum’s second failed marriage affected her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/df0c33c3ff2cd2d9618bc59f896403d5-fotor-20230619235739.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Arch_Kelley_III_Remarry></span>Did Arch Kelley III Remarry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a very private man, Arch never shared details about himself remarrying. We are yet to affirm if he did from other sources either. However, we know that his ex-wife got married to her one-time bodyguard, Daniel Roach.&nbsp;</p><p>They got married on November 22, 2003, in Tennessee. Sadly, like her first marriage, the second didn’t last long. Wynonna filed for a divorce in 2007 following Daniel’s arrest for <a href=#>sexually </a>assaulting a 13-year-old child.</p><p>Wynonna remarried again in 2012 to Scott “Cactus” Moser, popularly known as the drummer for Highway 101. That same year, Scott was involved in a motorcycle crash and was severely injured.</p><p>He had crossed the center line and hit a car on U.S. Route 16 in the Black Hills. The incident led to the amputation of his left leg. Since we are yet to confirm any news about their marriage crashing, we believe they are still together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0de165583e05f4c9dfb12452a35f9dbc-fotor-20230619235241.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Wynonna_Judds_First_Husband_Now></span>Where Is Wynonna Judd’s First Husband Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sadly, there’s no information on the current location of Arch Kelley III. The nonagenarian businessman has succeeded in shielding his life from the public. However, considering his age, we believe he is retired and likely in a caregiving center. However, his last known location is Tennessee.</p><p>We also don’t know if his children have ever been in contact with him since his separation from their mother. Either way, Arch did accumulate a reasonable amount of wealth to get the best care. Based on reports, he is said to have an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p>Another celebrity who left a trail of broken marriages in his life was the famous <a href=#>Pele</a>. Pele, like Wynonna, was a three-time husband in his life before his demise at age 82.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krrOvx2ainqScmsZutciiZKadlal6uMXNqKWnmV2fwqWw0mamp51dqbausYyhrKyakaOxcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cristina-ferrare.html>&#171;&nbsp;Husband of Cristina Ferrare | Net Worth in 2023, Age</a>
