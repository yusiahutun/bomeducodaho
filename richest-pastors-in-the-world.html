2023)</h1><div id=sub-header>February 2024 · 16 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/moneyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Joel-Osteen-750x501.jpg><p>When you think about pastors, chances are you first think about demure figures who choose to live a humble, simple life, but you may not realize that some of the richest pastors in the world have millions of dollars to their names.</p><p>Most pastors don’t make that much money. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Salary.com</a>, the average pastor makes anywhere from $87,081 to $120,084. This is no doubt a livable sum, but pastors of smaller churches often make less and the majority of pastors won’t be wealthy. However, pastors have the opportunity to make much more than their base salaries.</p><p>You may be wondering how a pastor can make so much money; well, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">richest religions</a> and their pastors can bring in lots of money because pastors don’t just address their congregations and lead their churches. As <a href=#>Church Fuel</a> points out, they also can earn money from counseling, motivational speaking, book writing, affiliate marketing, or starting a personal business. Thus, there’s no limit to how much a pastor can achieve.</p><p>While many of the top 20 richest pastors still maintain their modest dispositions and try to stay spiritually connected, that doesn’t mean they can’t earn some big bucks. Read more to see how pastors can earn tons of money. Here are the huge figures who have become the richest pastors in the world and have amassed staggering net worths.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Our Methodology</h2><p>There are so many pastors around the world that compiling a list of the 20 richest pastors takes a lot of patience and processing tons of information to find the most relevant facts available. Fortunately, we’ve done all the hard work to offer the most comprehensive list available. We want to be transparent about our approach to help readers understand the precision and care we have used.</p><p>We began the process by creating a list of some of the most prominent pastors around the world. We were then able to begin the research process to narrow down our list and shape it based on financial estimations. To get the best info possible, we use a range of sources and acknowledge that most wealthy people have diverse holdings, so rather than just having one income source, we have to look to various pursuits they may use to invest their money to make more money.</p><ul><li>Public records and websites offer invaluable information; government data, public filings, and relevant news reports or statistics can give us a better, sometimes exact, record of financial information and trends.</li><li>Comparative value asset allows us to estimate what certain assets may be worth, even if there are no publicly available records on these assets. When exact numbers are available, we use those, but sometimes, we must estimate based on similar information that we do have available.</li><li>Using insider information or self-disclosure from people on the list, we can further clarify the information. Quotes usually don’t give specifics, but they can add clues to what sort of ventures a figure may be earning from.</li><li>Academic or government studies are also used when necessary to add insight into the figures and their industry.</li><li>Mathematical equations and formulas are infused throughout the process to calculate net worths that reflect both the quantitative and qualitative data we have collected.</li></ul><p>This strenuous methodology means that each figure has been carefully considered. Additionally, as new information emerges, we work to update our list and adjust to reflect the most current wealth figure of the wealthiest pastors in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>20.

However, as the number of his audience grew, he changed the venue of his ministry several times. Due to the high number of attendees in his church, his ministry remains his primary source of income.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-15-enoch-adeboye-net-worth-39-million>15. Enoch Adeboye Net Worth – $39 million</h2><p>He is a Nigerian pastor and the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God.

Despite these criticisms, he has strived to focus on his mission and role in the church.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-14-benny-hinn-net-worth-40-million>14. Benny Hinn Net Worth – $40 million</h2><p>Benny is an Israeli speaker and televangelist. He is known for his association with The World Healing Center Church. He rose to fame in the late 1980s when he debuted his faith and revival meeting summits called “Miracle Crusades.” Besides the summits, he ran his Christian television program called “This Is Your Day.” Ultimately, the television show made him rich in the 1990s since it quickly became popular worldwide. With his newfound fame, he decided to write books, and they have also largely contributed to his wealth.</p><p>He hasn’t been beloved by all. He notably received criticism from Pastor Greg Locke for being a “false prophet,” but Locke has since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made amends for his past insults</a>. Benny Hinn has remained resilient even in the face of criticism.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-13-andy-stanley-45-million>13. Andy Stanley – $45 million</h2><p>Born Charlies Andrew Stanley, Andrew Stanley is the founder and chief pastor of the nondenominational ministries, North Point Ministries, which he based in Alpharetta Georgia.

Some of his popular books include:</p><ul><li>Better Decisions, Fewer Regrets</li><li>Sex & Dating</li><li>Deep & Wide</li><li>How to be Rich</li><li>Next Generation Leader</li><li>The New Rules for Love</li></ul><p>If a collection of books isn’t enough, Stanley started a TV program, Your Move with Andy Stanley, which began in 2012 and further spread his mission. It’s no wonder he has been called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most influential pastors</a> in the United States.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-12-jesse-duplantis-net-worth-50-million>12. Jesse Duplantis Net Worth – $50 million</h2><p>Jesse Duplantis is a minister of the Covenant Church. He preached his first sermon in 1976 when he was introduced to TBN by John Hagee. Later, he would become a full-time evangelist in 1978. His sermons are popular worldwide due to his sense of humor in his teachings.</p><p>In 2018, he controversially asked his audience to donate money to purchase a private jet worth $54 million. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christian Post</a>, he claimed he would use the jet to spread the gospel worldwide. However, he already owned three jets by that time, which further befuddled his followers. Despite the controversy, he is still financially benefiting from his spiritual leadership and business ventures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-11-paul-adefarasin-net-worth-50-million>11. Paul Adefarasin Net Worth – $50 million</h2><p>Paul was born into a wealthy family in Nigeria.

Uebert Angel Net Worth – $60 million</h2><p>Uebert is a British-Zimbabwean charismatic evangelical preacher and founder of Spirit Embassy in the United Kingdom. Though he acts as a preacher, that doesn’t mean he hasn’t had some scandals and hardships along the way.</p><p>As a Zimbabwe ambassador, he has come under fire for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly smuggling gold</a>. Such crimes have smudged his reputation, but this controversy is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">far from his first</a>. He has also been accused of other financial crimes. It is unclear how these scandals will impact his net worth.</p><p>Before becoming a pastor, he was already rich from his numerous business activities. For instance, he founded Club Millionaire Limited, which provided concierge services in Britain and engaged in the real estate business.

Additionally, he owns many cars in his garage, including a Ferrari worth $325,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-shepherd-bushiri-net-worth-110-million>8.

He and his wife were accused of committing crimes such as fraud. As a result, he experienced some final losses and was forced to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">auction off his property</a>.

A common book he publishes is the daily devotional bible called Rhapsody of Realities. The book has since been translated into hundreds of languages. It is a requirement for each member to have a copy of the book, so he is therefore guaranteed millions of dollars from selling this book.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-david-oyedepo-net-worth-150-million>5. David Oyedepo Net Worth – $150 million</h2><p>David is a Nigerian preacher, businessman, author, and founder of the Living Faith Church.

Also, he owns Dominion Publishing House, which publishes his books. These books are an extension of his mission and allow him to bring in more revenue.</p><p>Although there has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent speculation</a> about the pastor’s relationship with his son, his son, Isaac has denied being estranged from his father or the family’s church.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-valdemiro-santiago-net-worth-350-million>4. Valdemiro Santiago Net Worth – $350 million</h2><p>Valdemiro is a Brazilian pastor and leader of the World Church of the Power of God and has been a pastor for more than three decades. Before becoming the leader of this church, he was a preacher at the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.</p><p>He was allegedly expelled from that church due to misunderstandings between him and the management, but this incident seems to have transformed his future. Being expelled prompted him to start the World Church of the Power of God. He has since started several other churches.</p><p>Valdemiro Santiago has been able to magnify his wealth. In 2013, Forbes reported that he had a net worth of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$220 million</a>, but in the decade since, he has gotten up to $350 million. He has made some notable big purchases and bought a $45 million jet in 2012, showing the magnitude of his career as a pastor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-kenneth-copeland-net-worth-760-million>3. Kenneth Copeland Net Worth – $760 million</h2><p>Kenneth is an American televangelist, author, public speaker, and musician with ties to the Charismatic Movement. Most churches and critics generally regard him as the face of the prosperity gospel. Before he converted to Christianity and became a preacher in 1962, he was a recording artist. His love of music has continued throughout his spiritual career as well.</p><p>He even managed to have a hit in the Top 40 with his single titled “Pledge of Love.” His affluence mainly comes from his church’s donations. He has acquired a $20 million private jet and a $6.3 million lakefront mansion through donations. With the reliance on donations to fund his lifestyle, some people speculate that his net worth could even amount to $1 billion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-alph-lukau-net-worth-1-billion>2. Alph Lukau Net Worth – $1 billion</h2><p>Alph Lukau is a pastor and founder of Alleluia Ministries International in South Africa, though he has Congolese roots. Since starting his ministry in 2002, he has amassed thousands of members worldwide. His <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> channel shows his success, and he has more than 1.5 million followers on that platform alone. As a result of having so many followers, he has opened up branches in South Africa, Angola, Congo, Zambia, Namibia, DR Congo, and many other countries.</p><p>While Lukau’s church is his biggest pursuit, he certainly has made plenty of business ventures to get him over the billion-dollar mark. He has invested in big industries like energy, mining, education, and travel, which he pursues through the Alph Lukau Group.</p><p>At times, his wealth can seem garish to the public. The pastor owns a private jet, motorbikes, a Range Rover, a Rolls-Royce, and a Bentley. He makes headlines from time to time due to his luxurious lifestyle, but even with some criticism, many faithful people still accept him as an important spiritual leader.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-edir-macedo-net-worth-1-2-billion>1. Edir Macedo Net Worth – $1.2 billion</h2><p>Edir is a Brazilian religious leader, serving as an evangelical bishop. Currently, he is the richest pastor in the world; though, most of his money has stemmed from his business initiatives as a prominent media baron.</p><p>In 1977, he started his denomination in Rio de Janeiro called the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. It has steadily evolved into one of the largest denominations in the country. Well into his seventies, Edit Macedo has built up his legacy over decades of commitment to his church and a strong business ethic.</p><p>It was with the earnings from his church that he was able to buy Rede Record in 1990. He serves as the chairman and owner of Rede Record, Brazil’s third-largest television network. The television network is the major reason he is affluent, but it would have never been possible without his history as a religious leader. Later on, he opened another television network in Atlanta called W67CI, showing his continued commitment to building his empire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Some pastors may only engage with their audience once per week, but that doesn’t mean pastors don’t do much more. Pastors must deal with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">range of church activities</a>, including special events like weddings, staff meetings, ministry management, facility management, and religious-specific celebrations. Some pastors like to be even more hands-on and will manage most of the church functions and general spiritual health in their congregation.</p><p>Though pastors can get quite busy, those with big or rich churches can often hire people to help them run their churches. That means some pastors end up having too much time on their hands and they want to use their time wisely. It is no surprise that most of the pastors on this list have other interests besides pastoring.</p><p>Besides keeping themselves busy with other activities, these pastors can also achieve a high net worth from other <a href=#>side hustles</a>.
