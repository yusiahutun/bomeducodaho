But, we know the world of business is a highly fierce and competitive space,&nbsp;</p><p>What these budding entrepreneurs need is a trusted place where they can learn, grow, and groom themselves to become successful entrepreneurs. Turning this dream into reality is a visionary and exemplary entrepreneur.</p><p>Meet <strong>Kimberly Olson, CEO and Founder of The Goal Digger Girl</strong>. <strong>The Goal Digger Girl</strong> was founded in March of 2018 with its base of operations in Austin, Texas. The business was started with a mission to teach female entrepreneurs simple systems and online strategies in sales and marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>The Goal Digger Girl’s team understands the desire to build an online business, but learning the know-how to it is a whole other mountain to climb. In addition, most women are very limited on time, so they need automation in their business and tools they can easily implement into their businesses quickly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Energizing Women Entrepreneurs – The Goal Digger Girl&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Goal Digger Girl enables</a> small business owners to scale, so they can grow their monthly revenue with the same amount of work hours and resources. They have proven results with students beginning their programs and making a couple thousand per month, to then walking away with making five figures monthly from what they learned in the Goal Digger programs.&nbsp;</p><p>They have seen women in every stage of entrepreneurship. Whether they are a newbie and not making much money, to the highly seasoned professional who has been making money and sales for years. Some of these women are beginning their first coaching businesses with no prior coaching experience, discovering their passions while also learning how to get clients.</p><p>One of the major factors that set The Goal Digger Girl apart is the versatility of its programs. As they have students from all walks of life in their student base, pooling in from a variety of industries.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, they’ve had an artist selling only in galleries. With their mentoring and programs, she was able to pivot to selling her paintings primarily on Instagram. Another student, a professor at the university level, was able to quit her job and run her network marketing business full time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“The principles we teach apply to any business, which is extremely empowering”</strong> – The Goal Digger Girl Team</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Journey of The Goal Digger Girl and factors triggering their growth?</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges faced by the company was scaling to provide and serve the large volume of budding women entrepreneurs. The company was started by Kimberly as the only coach, now, it has grown to a team of crafted personnel who are more than capable of handling the large volume of students and day-to-day operations.</p><p>Another challenge the team overcame was creating a flawless learning architecture that houses all the nitty gritty, making it one of the easy-to-use and accessible learning platforms.</p><p>One of the major reasons triggering the growth of The Goal Digger Girl is owing to Kimberly’s ability to organically grow an audience and show up consistently on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of new coaches came onto the scene but then they disappear after a few months and have to start all over again. The Goal Digger Girl’s team has successfully and consistently kept themselves in tune with their audience, evolving, while identifying gaps in the market and filling them with their diverse program offerings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What establishes The Goal Digger Girl’s long-standing success?</h3><p>The reasons behind the company’s long-standing success are tenacity, grit, and perseverance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Everyone wants to be an entrepreneur but not everyone is willing to do what it takes to stay committed through the ups and downs. I did so much personal development work to cultivate a rock solid mindset and continue to do so which has allowed me to confidently make quick decisions and continue to lead this company with clarity and purpose.”</strong> – Kimberly Olson, CEO, The Goal Digger Girl</p><p>In their first full year in business, they earned $250,000 in revenue. In the past year, they generated $2.7 million and are 60% over that year-to-date. In addition, Kimberly has reached ~ 25,000 users on social media platforms when the company was created to over a million now!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Holistic programs of The Goal Digger Girl and what sets them apart?</h3><p>The core offerings of The Goal Digger Girl are group coaching programs, ranging from beginner entrepreneurs from one scaling to seven figures. They work with any niche that is building and scaling their student’s company online.&nbsp;</p><p>What sets their programs apart is the dual accreditation for program content and trainer of excellence. They are structured in a simple format that is easy to digest and implement around a busy lifestyle. Moreover, there is constant and rigorous support, and mentoring, making their programs results-oriented.</p><p><strong>“One thing that I do that I feel is special is promoting our clients to my audience on social media as much as possible to edify them and allow them to get valuable exposure. I have an abundant mindset and am always looking for ways to enable them. We also pay for an in-person beach retreat for our higher level programs and it is all the rage because lodging is included along with the training content and I think they feel very special.”</strong> – Kimberly Olson, CEO, The Goal Digger Girl</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How The Goal Digger Girl is taking its services ahead?</h3><p>The team is always on the lookout for new trends and practices. Apart from keeping a close view of their students, their learning experience, feedback, etc., they are constantly identifying the market.&nbsp;</p><p>If they see their students going elsewhere for anything beyond their program offerings, they know it’s time to roll out a new program. As their core group of students ascends in their businesses, they strongly believe in developing the next level of their programs to best meet and serve their needs.</p><p>The Goal Digger Girl and its team are getting closer to launching an all-in-one platform. This will allow entrepreneurs to have their email marketing, landing pages, course content, and other essential business tools all in one platform.</p><p>The team knows tech challenges can be a big obstacle for many, so they are excited to streamline the process and allow more simplicity to be implemented into their student’s businesses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Leading the Entrepreneurial Revolution – Kimberly Olson</h3><p>The Goal Digger Girl is truly an innovative concept and a class-apart company, venturing into teaching and nurturing budding women entrepreneurs. What makes the company, its programs, and its coaches so successful is a strong foundation, a strong set of core values, a vivacious, and extraordinary leader!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kimberly Olson is the CEO of The Goal Digger Girl.</h3><p>Kimberly Olson is a self-made multi-millionaire and the creator of The Goal Digger Girl, where she serves female entrepreneurs by teaching them simple systems and online strategies in sales and marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the<a href=#> power of social media</a>, she equipped students with online strategies to explode their presence and get real results in their business, genuinely and authentically. She is also the founder of the non-profit: Elephant Sisters.</p><p>Kimberly after receiving her undergraduate in Business Management and Marketing ran the district office as an independent contractor for Vector Marketing for almost 10 years. She then went on to pursue and complete two PhDs in Natural Health and Holistic Nutrition.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, she spent another decade speaking and training all over North America around health and wellness. During that time, Kimberly launched her first business, FitKim, and began learning about the world of online marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, she launched The Goal Digger Girl because she realized how passionate she was about sales and marketing. Thus, she decided to dedicate her life to teaching others how to build their dream businesses online!</p><p>Today, Kimberly is in the top half percent of her current network marketing company globally and is the author of five books including best-sellers, The Goal Digger, Why Balance is B.S., and BOSS It Up, Babe!.</p><p>She has a top 25-rated podcast in marketing and travels nationally for public speaking. Kimberly is a TEDx Talk speaker and her recent TEDx Talk was listed as one of the ‘10 Top TEDx Talks that You Don’t Want to Miss’.&nbsp;</p><p>Kimberly has also been honored as one of the ‘Top 20 Life Coaches to Look Out for in 2022’, and ‘Top 10 Most Ambitious Women in Business to Follow’ and is a part of <strong>the Forbes Coaches Council</strong>.</p><p>She has also been named as one of the ‘Top 20 Life Coaches to Look Out for in 2022’ by the Entrepreneur’s Herald.

Also, she was awarded the honor of ‘Top CEO for 2022’ by the International Association of Top Professionals!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kimberly’s thoughts on the responsibilities of an entrepreneur?&nbsp;</h3><p>Entrepreneurs need to be able to cast a vision for their company and develop the strategy to execute that vision. I think so many entrepreneurs get caught up in the doing that they don’t spend enough time working on their business to take it to the next level and allow it to continue to evolve.&nbsp;</p><p>Entrepreneurs also need to be able to trust themselves and make quick decisions and do what’s right for the company, not necessarily based on how they feel about it.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you look after your employees? What makes your team unique?&nbsp;</h3><p>The team of The Goal Digger Girl works remotely but the management and leadership make sure they are well taken care of. They do in-person retreats a few times a year, enjoy a paid staff self-care day monthly, and also an employee stipend to be used for a gym membership or towards a rejuvenating massage.&nbsp;</p><p>But most importantly, the coaches know what they are offering their students and how it can benefit them. They know the importance of becoming a successful entrepreneur, and strive day-in- and out to make The Goal Digger Girl and its programs indomitable.&nbsp;</p><p>The team knows they can always go to Kimberly owing to her caring, nurturing, and captivating persona.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I am also very direct with them and I think that is very important. Our team is unique because I’ve hired each person based on intuition and know they are all supposed to be here”</strong>, Kimberly adds.</p><p><strong>“We become what we think about most of the time, and that’s the strangest secret.” – </strong>Earl Nightingale</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kimberly’s views on constant vigilance as a need or a strategy?&nbsp;</h3><p>It is an absolute need. If the past couple of years has taught us anything it is that nothing is guaranteed. As the leader of the company, it is our responsibility to constantly be assessing how the market is trending and prepare, especially financially, for the ups and downs that every business can experience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kimberly’s take on the rat race in the market?</h3><p>I don’t feel like I’m coping; I feel like I’m constantly aspiring to achieve the next climb up the mountain which is very fulfilling and keeps me going. Seeing the results of my clients and how their lives are transforming gets me up in the morning!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMGpsYygppqkXZm2qLPEq2SgoaKheqa606ucqaqVo7K2vsiao2acopqurg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./spanx-strapless-bra-review-labor-day-sale-2023-7964475.html>&#171;&nbsp;I'm a Spanx-Obsessed Editor, and This Is Its Best Strapless Bra</a>
