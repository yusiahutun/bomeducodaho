Nia Long is renowned for her work in “Black Cinema.” However, she rose to prominence after starring in the 1991 film “Boyz n the Hood,” and her portrayal of Beulah Lisa Wilkes on the NBC sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” from 1991-1995.</p><p>Like Kez’s mom, his father, Ime Udoka, is a successful retired NBA player. Ime is an American-Nigerian professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Kez Sunday Udoka got the attention of fans after his parent’s scandal became public.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about the celebrity kid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-06-09-fotor-202307254116.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Nia_Longs_Son></span>How Old Is Nia Long’s Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kez Sunday Udoka is 11 years old. He was born in Los Angeles, California, United States of America, on November 7, 2011. Kez is of African-American ethnicity. Also, he is of Nigerian, American, Trinidadian, Barbadian, and Grenadian descent, thanks to his parent’s rich heritage. The 11-year-old celebrity kid is a big fan of the Boston Celtics, where his father worked as the head coach before he got suspended.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being a celebrity kid, details about Kez Sunday Udoka rarely appear in the media. He is the first and only child his parents had together, and they shield him from the spotlight. Consequently, details regarding his education elude the public. However, online reports suggest that he attends a local middle school.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Kez_Sunday_Udoka_Have_a_Sibling></span>Does Kez Sunday Udoka Have a Sibling?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he does. While Kez Sunday Udoka is the only child of his parents, he is not his mother’s only son. Nia Long has a son, Maasai Zhivago Dorsey II, from her previous relationship with Massai Z. Dorsey, a fellow American actor famous for his role in “Third Watch” and “The Single Moms Club.” Hence, Kez is Nia Long’s second child and son.&nbsp;</p><p>Long and Dorsey met on NBC’s “Third Watch” set in 1999 and started dating. Although online reports suggested Dorsey was Long’s fifth romantic relationship, their love progressed quickly. After dating for a year, the couple decided they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. They got engaged and started planning for their wedding ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the former couple called off their engagement ten months after they announced it for unknown reasons. However, a few months before they parted ways, Nia Long, who was already pregnant, welcomed her first son. She gave birth to Massai, in Los Angeles, on November 20, 2000, and co-parents him with her ex.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Kez Sunday Udoka and Massai are half-siblings, they share a close bond. They spend time with their mother, who adores them both. While the brothers don’t make many public appearances, they appear together on their mother’s Instagram.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-06-33-fotor-2023072541145.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Kez_Sunday_Udoka_Have_a_Social_Media_Presence></span>Does Kez Sunday Udoka Have a Social Media Presence?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he doesn’t. His parents, Long and Ime, are one of the few celebrity parents who do not subscribe to letting their kids have a social media presence. Hence, Kez Sunday Udoka does not have an account on any social media platform. The 11-year-old celebrity kid spends most of his time focusing on his education and creating real-life connections.</p><p>On the other hand, his famous mother has a massive social media presence. She has over 4 million followers on Instagram and over 1 million on Twitter, where she shares pictures of her sons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-06-41-fotor-2023072541041.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Kez_Sunday_Udokas_Parents_Still_Together></span>Are Kez Sunday Udoka’s Parents Still Together?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, they are not. “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” actress and then-basketball player for the Sacramento Kings of the NBA met in Boston in February 2010 after a mutual friend introduced them. While Long was filming for NBC, Ime played against the Boston Celtics. The then-couple spent their first date talking in the hotel lobby and went to an Italian restaurant in the North End of Boston the following night. Afterward, the two became a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, the now-separated couple announced they were expecting a child. They revealed the news in an interview on June 17, 2011, and had their son later that year. After five years and a son together, Long and Udoka announced their engagement on May 26, 2015.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-06-47-fotor-202307254109.jpg><p>However, their dreamy relationship came crashing after Boston Celtics issued a statement regarding Ime’s possible suspension from his Celtics head coach position in September 2022. The former basketball player allegedly had a consensual intimate relationship with a woman on the team’s staff. Although consensual, the affair violates team guidelines. Consequently, <a href=#>Nia Long and Ime Udoka</a> split amidst the cheating scandal in 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Nia_Longs_Son_Do></span>What Does Nia Long’s Son Do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like most celebrity kids his age, he has yet to choose a career path. Kez Sunday Udoka is enjoying a life of luxury thanks to his parent’s fortune. While his mom has a net worth of $9,000,000, his dad has a net worth of $6,000,000.</p><p>While it is unknown which career path Kez Sunday Udoka will choose, fans hope to see the celebrity kid thrive like Melissa McCarthy’s daughter, <a href=#>Georgette Falcone</a>, in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuKbGjKysp5yRrnq2sM6kmGallZrBbq3Crameq6Niu6qtjKWmp5%2BjYsCmr86nm2arn6N8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meghan-markle-relationship-history-prince-harry-trevor-engelson.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meghan Markle's full relationship history - from Steve Lepore to Prince Harry</a>
